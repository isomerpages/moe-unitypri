Due to the Covid travel restrictions in 2022, a Virtual Overseas Immersion Programme (VOIP) for 34 selected P5 students was organised to provide opportunities for students to develop their communication skills in ML and inculcate the appreciation of Malay culture in an experiential manner.

On 30 May 22, the tour guide in Brunei "brought" our students to outskirts of Omar Ali Saifuddien Mosque and "boarded" a ferry to show the students around Kampong Ayer. This livestream video experience with the tour guide was thoroughly interactive to keep the students immersed with the virtual reality setting. The students engaged the tour guide with questions about Brunei and learned the way of life of the people living in Kampong Ayer. It was fascinating for the students to understand the self-sufficiency of Kampong Ayer with accessibilities to a floating hospital, police post and a fire station despite being far away from the mainland.

They learned the techniques of basket weaving and afterwards, put on their creative hats to produce their very own original patterns. Our students challenged themselves weaving and showed resilience, concentration, and patience throughout the activities. They also attempted batik painting and different techniques used in Brunei’s batik like marbling, airbrushing and sprinkling, uniquely different from those in Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia.

The highly anticipated activity was the school interaction between our students and students from Sekolah Tunas Jaya PGGMB Lambak. This session conducted on 25 August 22 provided opportunities for our students to enhance their use of the Malay Language in an authentic environment.  They were ambassadors of the UPS and Singapore as they shared about the subjects and programmes offered by the school and the places of interest, food and festivals in Singapore.

During the allocated snack break, the students were given the chance to feast on the traditional Brunei snacks provided.

Students enjoyed their VOIP to Brunei Darussalam. Despite the limitations of remaining in Singapore, it did not take away the engaging experience and learning opportunities.
