### **The National School Game Achievement 2023**
The NSG games commenced this year with changes to game format allowing teams to play more games and in tiered groupings.  All our sports groups took part in the competition.  We are proud to garner commendable achievements in the following games:

The **Senior Boys Football team** did extremely well coming in 4th in the West Zone Senior Division and eventually 2nd in Nationals.  Throughout the competition they showed remarkable perseverance and dedication, culminating in the impressive championship win.

At the zonal level, our **Senior Boys Basketball team** came in top 8.  While the competition was tough, their hard work, determination and teamwork paid off and resulted in the outstanding achievement.  Their counterparts the **Junior Boys Basketball team**, also did us proud.  They emerged top position in the Tier 3 Group competition.

The school also supported students who took part in non-school CCA NSG Games.
