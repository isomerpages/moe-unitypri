#### Engagement

In Unity Primary, we emphasize on learning by doing. From concrete manipulatives and experiences, students are guided to uncover abstract mathematical concepts and results. Students engage in activities to explore and learn mathematical concepts and skills. We stress the use of C-P-A in the learning of mathematics. (Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract). We believe in making learning of mathematics fun, meaningful and relevant.

We adopt Polyaâ€™s steps in problem solving, infusing the use of effective questioning into their thought processes.

Effective questioning can scaffold thinking and aid problem-solving.
