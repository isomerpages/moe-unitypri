Character and Citizenship Education
===================================

### **Vision**
----------

Students from Unity Primary will grow up to be responsible and respectful citizens with integrity

### **Mission**

### Programme Highlights/Enrichment Activities
------------------------------------------

##### **Character Development**

**1) Student Leadership**

In Unity, we believe that every child can be a leader. With this firm belief, all students are given opportunities to learn leadership skills and platforms to exemplify these skills.

To ensure we achieve our student outcome of developing Effective Communicators, Student Leadership training incorporates effective communication skills so that students see the importance of being able to articulate and communicate effectively to become competent leaders. Progressive development in the leadership training also ensures student leaders are equipped with the appropriate skills in order to carry out their duties.

**2) Caught in Action! (CIA)**

In Unity where students exemplify the school values, students are rewarded when they are “caught” doing good deeds. FOS ambassadors and teachers are always on the lookout for acts of graciousness and appreciation.

Classes and individuals embodying the school values are presented with tokens of appreciation and their stories of good deeds shared with the school.

**3) Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP) and i-Character**

The main objectives of FTGP are to provide for quality interaction time between Form Teachers and Co-Form Teachers and students, and to equip students with social and emotional (SE) competencies.

Conducting once a week, FTGP lessons allows purposeful student-teacher interactions and the explicit teaching of SE competencies. Studentswill experience positive school experiences that support their holistic development and better prepare them for life.

Form teachers and Co-Form Teachers also use FTGP period to conduct structured reflections in the i-Character booklet where students are given time to do self-assessments and values reflections. Parents are also involved in the endorsement of these reflections, as parents play an integral role in the holistic development of a child.
