### **Marina Barrage** 
Recently, the P5 students went on a learning journey to Marina Barrage, where they spent the afternoon learning more about environmental and sustainability topics such as climate, water, energy and waste. They also learnt the 3-in-1 function of the Barrage and got to watch how the crest gates work as a flood control measure, and explored the Sustainable Singapore Gallery. Some students shared that the highlight of the learning journey was the Augmented Reality (AR) Interactive Experience, where they got to enjoy and appreciate the marine life and coral reefs right before them!![](/images/Learning%20Journeys/2022/Primary%205/2022%20P5%20Marina%20Barrage.jpg)
### **Indian Heritage Centre**
The P5 students went on a learning journey to the Indian Heritage Centre to better understand the culture and heritage of Singaporeâ€™s Indian community. They travelled back in time, to learn how the immigrants arrived in Singapore from the Indian subcontinent and became part of our social fabric. The Indian community influenced and helped to shape our multi-cultural, multi-racial island nation. Students enjoyed themselves thoroughly at the Indian Heritage Centre in the heart of Little India as they explored the various galleries learning more about the food, spices, business, performing arts and architecture of one of the major ethnic communities in Singapore.
