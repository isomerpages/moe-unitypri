School Leaders’ Message
=======================
![](/images/Final.png)

Unity Primary School was established in 1999 and this year, we celebrate our 23rd Anniversary!

As we inspire and educate our young charges, we cannot do it alone. Parents play an equally critical role in our children’s education. It is imperative that the school and families work collaboratively in order to yield the best educational outcomes. The primary school years solidify the foundation for learning; however, your fullest support in ensuring your child comes to school prepared to learn is essential for their continual development.

We seek to deliver a holistic education that makes learning meaningful, builds character and ensures that every child is equipped with the skills and competencies to navigate the future. We are committed to providing quality teaching and learning in and out of classrooms and value adding to the lives of our students. As stated in MOE Singapore Curriculum Philosophy, we believe that learning flourishes in caring and safe learning environment; when children construct knowledge actively; through the development of thinking skills and dispositions; and when assessment is used to address learning gaps.

As stewards of lives, we take pride in our work and consider it a privilege to be able to nurture and mould the future of Singapore. We envisage developing every student to have a ‘Creative Mind’, become a ‘Confident Self’, have a ‘Caring Heart’ and that all our students will become **somebody** one day, leaving an indelible mark wherever they go!

We know that 2022 will be an equally exciting year for all our students, especially our Primary 1 students as they embark on the next phase of their education journey. Our students will always be at the core of our mission and they can look forward to many opportunities for development such as learning to get along with friends from different background, learning about our fragile natural environment, and more importantly, learning more about themselves and what they are good at!

With your continued support and partnership, we forge ahead with faith as always in touching lives and transforming futures!
