### **Race to Sustainability (Gardens by the Bay)**

Race to Sustainability at Gardens by the Bay is an annual event for our P6 students. Using their IT skills and devices, students navigate clues and codes, tackling tasks that emphasize teamwork and their understanding of environmental messages learned both in and out of school.<br>
On 23 October 2024, the P6 students had a fantastic time outdoors, exploring the lush flora at Gardens by the Bay and enjoying the company of their classmates and teachers on their final learning journey before graduating from Unity Primary School. To wrap up the experience, they engaged in a Math and Science trail designed by our teachers, solving puzzles such as calculating the area and height of the Supertrees and learning about global threats to vegetation.<br>
This year, a group of selected Primary 2 students had the special opportunity to join the official flag-off event in the morning. They participated in the 1-hour "Green Garden, Green Singapore!" facilitated programme and interacted with Ms. Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment and Minister-in-charge of Trade Relations, who joined in the hands-on activities.<br>
It was a truly enriching and unforgettable experience for both students and staff.

### **Learning Journey to Singapore Discovery Centre**
To deepen their understanding of how Singapore has progressed since gaining independence, the Primary 6 students went on a learning journey to the Singapore Discovery Centre (SDC) where they experienced the Singapore Story from the past to the present through a multi-sensory approach. Through various activities, such as the interactive videos and games, students learnt more about the different challenges Singapore faced in the past as well as the future challenges the nation might face. Students then reflected on how these challenges could be overcome as a nation.<br>
Besides the exhibitions at SDC, students also had a chance to hop onto the SAFTI Military Institute bus for an exclusive tour around the training ground for officers-to-be. They got a glimpse into the life of an officer cadet and the role of the Singapore Armed Forces in the defence and security of Singapore. <br>
To end off their experience at SDC, students watched a short film at the iWERKS Theatre, Singapore’s largest flat-screen theater. The short film, Long Pants, is a heartwarming tale of tenacity and resilience based on a true-life account. 
The students thoroughly enjoyed their experience at SDC!

### **Ancient Civilisations Museum**

History came alive for the Primary 6 students during a Museum-Based Learning Journey to the Ancient Civilisations Museum. 

As students went from one station to another, the knowledgeable museum educators shared captivating stories and artefacts that unravelled historical moments. Being able to relate some of the stories to what they had learnt during Social Studies lessons, the students responded enthusiastically to the questions posed by the museum educators.

At the end of the learning journey, the students could explain how Singapore’s cultural heritage had evolved over time, influenced by the diverse mix of cultures. Additionally, they had gained a deeper understanding of the cultural and historical ties that had influence on the countries in Southeast Asia

### **Learning Journey to Sungei Buloh**
Nothing beats going out into nature and observing animals in their habitat! That was what the P6 students experienced when they spent half their morning soaking in the sun to hike Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserves. They observed the diversity of living things forming the mangrove community and realized the importance of mangrove in the ecosystem. They were lucky to encounter the mudskippers in the muddy waters, the monitor lizards taking a dip in the pond and catching sights of some of the migratory birds grazing on the mudflats. The learning journey complemented the Science topics of Living Together and Adaptations which the students learnt in class. Students had much fun learning beyond the classroom.
