Project work is a platform that allows students to make links of their knowledge across different subject areas as well as to demonstrate their creativity and innovation to an assigned project task. They get to hone their skills as an effective communicator to present their ideas clearly to the targeted audience in both written and oral forms. Students will acquire collaborative skills as they work in groups to achieve common goals. Through PW, we are a promoting self-directed learning as they do their independent research and reflection.
