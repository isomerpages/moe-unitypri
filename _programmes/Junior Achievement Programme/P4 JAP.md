### **Our Community**
The Primary 4 students delved into how individuals could benefit from and contribute to their communities, as well as gained insights into the role of taxes in supporting government services. They also explored various career paths and the skills needed for different jobs. As part of their learning, they engaged in a hands-on group activity where they innovated a production process by creating a unique donut, fostering creativity and teamwork. It was an enriching and enjoyable experience, making the two-day programme memorable for the students and teachers.
