### **Museum Based Learning**
The P4 Museum Based Learning (MBL) is part of the refreshed art education syllabus aimed at making learning more authentic and for exposure to Singaporean art. MBL offers a unique and effective approach to education that leverages the resources and environments provided by museums to create engaging and memorable learning experiences. 

Museums offer a hands-on, interactive, and multisensory environment that encourages experiential learning. Our students engage with exhibits through observation and discussion to enhance the learning process.

Museums often cover a wide range of topics, from history and science to art and culture. This allows for interdisciplinary learning, where students can explore connections between different subject areas.

MBL encourages critical thinking and inquiry-based learning. Students are prompted to ask questions, analyze information, and draw their own conclusions as they interact with exhibits and displays.

MBL not only cultivate interest but also lifelong learners who can continue to explore new topics and expand their knowledge through more museum visits.
### **Geylang Serai Heritage Gallery**
Primary 4 students had the opportunity to go on a Learning Journey to the Geylang Serai Heritage Gallery after a hiatus of 2 years. They got to play the role of explorers to find out more about the history of Geylang Serai and its significance to the Malay and Muslim communities in Singapore. In total, they  explored 4 stations across the gallery. At each station were educators who were former residents in the area, to make the history come to life with their captivating stories and interesting artefacts. Students were immersed into the stories shared by these educators. They discovered more about the early origins of Geylang Serai where cash crop plantations were grown. This included the cultivation of lemongrass also known as serai in Malay which the area was named after. Students were also fascinated by the artefacts such as the life-sized gasing (spinning top) used in the leisure activities of yesteryears. They admired one of the artefacts adorned beautifully with striking colours, known as ‘hantaran dulang’, a gift tray presented by a groom to the bride. They also learnt how Geylang Serai came to be known as a marketplace for special occasions like weddings for the Malay community. All in all, the students had an exciting and enriching learning experience.
