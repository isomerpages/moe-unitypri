## **Ourselves**
Through stories, role-play and a series of fun and exciting hands-on activities , the Primary 1 students got to learn about the difference between needs and wants, the importance of saving money and donating to worthy causes.Â  At the end of the programme, they even made a piggy bank that they could bring home!
