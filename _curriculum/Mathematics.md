The Mathematics Department aims to develop in students a love for Mathematics and apply problem-solving skills to other disciplines. We aim to do this via:
* Making the learning of Mathematics relevant and interesting.
* Building a strong foundation in numeracy.

In UPS, we follow the MOE Mathematics Framework closely.
The framework sets the direction for teaching, learning and assessment practices in school.

##### **Broad-based Programmes:**
* Heuristic Booklet (P1 to P6)
* Brain Gym (P1 to P4)
* Speed Tests (P5 to P6)
* iLoveMath Pre-Assemblies & Termly Math Mania Quizzes (P1 to P6)
* Math Games Day (P1 to P5)

##### **Customised Programmes:**
* Focused Remediation
* E2K Mathematics (P4 to P6)

##### **Engagement**
We emphasize on learning by doing. From concrete manipulatives and experiences, students are guided to uncover abstract mathematical concepts and results. Students engage in activities to explore and learn mathematical concepts and skills. We stress the use of Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract (C-P-A) in the learning of Mathematics. We strive to make learning of Mathematics fun, meaningful and relevant.

##### **Strategies**

We devised the SPARK framework (adapted from Polya’s 4 steps in problem solving) to help guide and scaffold students’ thinking process during problem-solving.
