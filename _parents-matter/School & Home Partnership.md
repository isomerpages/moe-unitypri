<p>The Ministry of Education (MOE) has refreshed the Guidelines for School-Home
Partnership to support parents and teachers with the goal to raise a happy,
confident and kind generation together. With the emphasis on strengthening
school-home partnerships, the school has contextualised MOE's guidelines
into a set of UPS School-Home Partnership Guidelines.</p>
