<h3><strong>Around the School &amp; Road Safety Walk</strong></h3>
<p>Our P1 students had a fantastic time during their first Learning Journey
this term! Accompanied by their form teachers, Parent Volunteers and school
Operation Managers, the students explored the school vicinity. During their
walk, they learnt about the different types of road crossings, road signs
and road safety rules.</p>
<p>Before heading out, the students had discissions with their teachers about
how to use shared spaces responsibly, respectful use of common spaces and
how to upkeep harmony in the community when using these spaces. This helped
them understand how to be mindful of others when using public areas.</p>
<p>As part of the journey, the students also practised road safety as they
crossed both formal and informal crossings. The highlight of the outing
was the opportunity to play with their classmates at a nearby playground
while practising safe and mindful behaviour.</p>
<p>It was indeed a fun and meaningful experience that helped the students
connect with the community while learning important life skills!</p>

<h3><strong>Jacob Ballas</strong></h3>
<p>On 8 May 2025, our P1 students embarked on their much-anticipated Learning
Journey to the Jacob Ballas Children’s Garden, located in the Singapore
Botanic Gardens. Specially designed for young children, the garden provided
a safe and stimulating environment for our students to explore and learn
about nature.</p>
<p>The students participated in a variety of hands-on activities across five
interactive stations curated to provide unique learning experiences. They
learnt about plant life cycles, habitats, and the importance of caring
for the environment. The experiences also fostered teamwork and curiosity
as students worked together to discover the natural world around them.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, wet weather conditions prevented some classes from visiting
the garden. As part of the wet weather contingency plan, they participated
in a specially prepared e-Learning Journey instead. Though disappointing,
the students were still given meaningful opportunities to engage with and
learn the same key concepts.</p>
<p>For those who attended the learning journey, it was a truly memorable
day filled with exploration and discovery, learning, and joy in nature!</p>

<h3><strong>River Wonders</strong></h3>
<p>On 30 September 2024, the P1 students went on a learning journey to River
Wonders. A pre-learning journey lesson was conducted to introduce the various
zones at River Wonders and prepare the students for the trip. Together
with their form teachers and parent volunteers, the students engaged in
several tasks at the Mekong River, Giant Panda Forest and Amazon Flooded
Forest. They were captivated by the Manatees at the Amazon Flooded Forest
and were thrilled to see the Electric Eel, Piranha and Red Panda. The Giant
Stingrays at the Mekong River left them in awe. The highlight of the trip
was getting to see Jia Jia and Kai Kai at the Panda enclosure. Overall,
the learning journey was a great success. It enhanced the students’ knowledge
of the different animals and strengthened their bonds with each other.</p>
