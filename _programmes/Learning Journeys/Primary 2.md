<h3><strong>Hay Dairies Goat Farm</strong></h3>
<p>Our Primary 2 students get a taste of rural life during their visit to
Hay Dairies Goat Farm in Neo Tiew Crescent. This learning journey introduces
them to Singapore’s local agriculture and offers a close-up view of farm
operations.</p>
<p>Students learn about goat breeds, the milking process, and how goat milk
compares to cow milk in terms of nutrition. The highlight of the trip is
the interactive goat feeding session, where students get to offer alfalfa
hay and even pet the goats gently—an exciting and memorable experience
for many.</p>
<p>The visit ends with a treat: each child brings home a bottle of chocolate
goat milk and a souvenir. More than just a fun day out, this journey encourages
empathy towards animals and nurtures a deeper appreciation for nature and
farming.</p>

<h3><strong>Theatre Experience</strong></h3>
<p>As part of the school’s Learn for Life Programme to inculcate character
and values through experiential and authentic learning, the Primary 2 students
embarked on a learning journey to Gateway Theatre to watch a performance
entitled ‘The Invisible Pangolin’ on 25 July 2024. The theatre experience
provides the opportunity for the students to practise correct theatre etiquette
and value of respect during a performance.
<br>‘The Invisible Pangolin’ is about three friends, a Monkey, Owl and Tiger
who come across a mysterious ball that turns out to be a classmate (Pangolin)
whom they have never “seen” before. “The Invisible Pangolin” is an interactive
theatre experience that delves into the themes of friendship, embracing
differences, being noticed, the importance of saying “no” and the value
of giving space.
<br>The performance was enchanting, captivating the young audience from the
very first moment. The vibrant costumes and colourful set design created
a whimsical world that instantly drew the children in. The actors, with
their animated expressions and lively movements, brought the characters
to life in a way that was both magical and relatable. The dialogue and
interactions resonated with the young audience, eliciting laughter and
gasps of amazement.
<br>As the show came to an end, the theater erupted with applause. The learning
journey was truly an unforgettable experience. When the students returned
to school, they reflected happily on their favourite parts and characters
of the performance.</p>

<h3><strong>River Wonders</strong></h3>
<p>At the end of Term 2, students visit River Wonders, an exciting continuation
of their wildlife education journey.</p>
<p>From the Amazon Flooded Forest to the Giant Panda Forest, students are
enthralled by creatures like manatees, stingrays, electric eels, and piranhas.
A major highlight is spotting Le Le napping on a tree branch alongside
his mother, Jia Jia—a moment students won’t soon forget.</p>
<p>Beyond the animal encounters, this trip allows classmates to bond as they
explore and learn together outside the classroom.</p>

<h3><strong>Supermarket</strong></h3>
<p>As part of the Life Skills Development Programme to promote financial
literacy, the P2 students embarked on a E-learning Journey to the supermarket
to learn how to manage the limited budget that they had in preparation
for an event. They participated in the planning for a class party by learning
how to purchase items online from the supermarket websites.
<br>Before the planning, the students were introduced to the following concepts:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Estimation</p>
</li>

<p>Budgeting</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reading of the nutrition labels of items</p>

<p>Difference between needs and wants</p>

</ul>
<p>To further apply these concepts into daily lives, the students planned
their own purchase of snacks for a week when they visited the supermarket
with their parents or family members. It was definitely an enriching and
interactive experience for the P2 students.</p>
