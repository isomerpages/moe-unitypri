### **Outdoor Education Learning Journey**
P4 level students had a fantastic experience during the recent Outdoor Education Learning Journey to Limbang Park. The adventure in the outdoor setting provided numerous opportunities for learning, fun, and appreciation of nature.
Armed with their new PE Journal, they eagerly embarked on a quest to draw their experience maps. In another activity, the young learners connected with nature in a unique way through observing the unique trees at the park. They learned about parasitic plants living on the host trees and the characteristics of the different trees. Students explored the neighbourhood outdoor nature parks to increase their awareness of the green spaces in the community and develop their skills in a big classroom unlike any other - full of wonder, discovery, and endless lessons waiting to be learned.

As responsible adventurers, the students learned the importance of packing a healthy snack for their outdoor journey. Before setting off, they thoughtfully prepared a variety of nutritious treats, including fresh fruits, whole-grain sandwiches, and energy-boosting nuts. Their willingness to make mindful food choices was commendable. Our students showed exemplary responsibility by ensuring they kept their hands clean before eating. Knowing the importance of maintaining personal hygiene, especially when enjoying the great outdoors, the students used hand sanitizers and wipes to stay fresh and germ-free while relishing their healthy snacks. 

Our students embraced the opportunity to connect with nature to nurture their minds and bodies as well as learn valuable life skills.  The Outdoor Education Learning Journey to Limbang Park was undoubtedly a huge success.

During the recent learning journey to the Geylang Serai Heritage Gallery, the Primary 4 students had the opportunity to play the role of explorers. They went on a mission to discover the history of Geylang Serai and its importance to the Malay and Muslim communities in Singapore. The students explored the gallery and visited four different stations, each with friendly educators who told stories and showed interesting objects to make history come alive.

### **MTL Chinese Cultural Programme Exposure Scheme (CPES)**
The Chinese Cultural Programme Exposure Scheme (CPES) is an initiative designed to enhance the students' learning of Chinese Language through immersive cultural experiences. By exposing students to captivating and related cultural performances presented by both local and international arts groups, CPES aims to cultivate a deeper appreciation for Chinese Language and its culture.<br>
This year, our P4 students attended a live performance entitled "Mr. Smart" 《聪明先生》, presented by Arts Theatre Pte Ltd at Stamford Arts Centre Black Box Theatre on Wednesday, 31 July. The engaging performance provided students with a unique opportunity to learn more about Chinese idioms and folklore in a fun and interactive way.<br>
As the performance was filled with witty dialogues and humorous situations, it kept our students entertained throughout. The interactive elements allowing students to engage with the performers further enhanced the learning experience.  The students not only expanded their vocabulary but also gained a deeper understanding of Chinese culture and traditions.<br>
Indeed the learning journey was a resounding success, demonstrating the power of cultural experiences in fostering a love for the learning of Chinese Language.
