<h3><strong>P3 Social Etiquette</strong></h3>
<p>Developing good etiquette and social manners is crucial for the personal,
social, and emotional growth of children. In Term 2, all our Primary 3
students participated in a Social Etiquette programme spanning over three
sessions. They learned the art of making a positive impression through
proper self-introduction and greetings as well as received guidance on
basic grooming, online etiquette, and appropriate behaviour in school and
public settings. Their instructors used engaging presentations, activities,
and videos to captivate their interest. The students applied what they
learned by engaging in role-playing activities with their peers, practising
self-introductions and discussing case studies in class. By instilling
good etiquette and mannerisms in these students, we aim to nurture their
confidence and communication skills, paving the way for them to become
respectful and confident adults.</p>

<h3><strong>P4 Cyber wellness</strong></h3>
<p>With the rapid changes and trends of the digital world, educating the
students on the responsible use of ICT is our proactive approach to prevent
and mitigate risks associated with its use.</p>
<p>Over a few sessions in Term 2, all Primary 4 students went through a Cyberwellness
programme where they learned how to navigate the cyber world, express themselves
appropriately online, handle online content and behaviour, develop safe,
respectful, and meaningful relationships, as well as maintain a healthy
balance of online and offline activities. The instructors engaged the students
through exciting videos, games, and interactions. The students applied
what they had learned by discussing various scenarios with their peers,
e.g., self-introduction during an online discussion, identifying fake news,
and talking to a trusted adult when in doubt.</p>
<p>By equipping the students with the knowledge and skills, we seek to equip
them with the tools to practise discernment, make wise decisions, and protect
themselves online as they navigate the cyber world.</p>
