### **Marina Barrage** 
Recently, the P5 students went on a learning journey to Marina Barrage, where they spent the afternoon learning more about environmental and sustainability topics such as climate, water, energy and waste. They also learnt the 3-in-1 function of the Barrage and got to watch how the crest gates work as a flood control measure, and explored the Sustainable Singapore Gallery. Some students shared that the highlight of the learning journey was the Augmented Reality (AR) Interactive Experience, where they got to enjoy and appreciate the marine life and coral reefs right before them!![](/images/Learning%20Journeys/2022/Primary%205/2022%20P5%20Marina%20Barrage.jpg)
### **Indian Heritage Centre**
The P5 students went on a learning journey to the Indian Heritage Centre to better understand the culture and heritage of Singaporeâ€™s Indian community. They travelled back in time, to learn how the immigrants arrived in Singapore from the Indian subcontinent and became part of our social fabric. The Indian community influenced and helped to shape our multi-cultural, multi-racial island nation. Students enjoyed themselves thoroughly at the Indian Heritage Centre in the heart of Little India as they explored the various galleries learning more about the food, spices, business, performing arts and architecture of one of the major ethnic communities in Singapore.

### **DNA Learning Lab** 
The P5 students unraveled the secrets of life and marveled at the sight of cells under the microscope when they visited the DNA Learning Lab at the Singapore Science Centre. The learning journey stimulated the students' interest in Science as they experienced authentic learning by using the equipment and techniques adopted by scientists in research labs. Through the hands-on activity, the students took on the role of a scientist where they prepared sample slides using their own cheek cells and viewing them under the microscope. They also had the opportunity to observe the parts of plant cell clearly and learn more about the yeast cell as well as the bacteria cell.

### **NE Show**
As usual, every year, the Primary 5 students will attend the National Education Show (NE Show), a preview of the upcoming National Day Parade. This special event provides P5 students with a unique opportunity to fully engage in the celebratory atmosphere of our nation's independence. <br>
Donned in vibrant red T-shirts, the P5 students from Unity Primary exuded enthusiasm and patriotism as they participated in the festive atmosphere at the Padang on 6 July. They observed the various aspects of Total Defence in action, demonstrating the unity and preparedness of our nation. The festivities culminated in a spectacular fireworks display, illuminating the night sky and symbolizing the spirit of togetherness and celebration.<br>
Through this immersive experience, the P5 students have gained a deeper understanding of the significance of National Education, reinforcing the values of unity, resilience, and the collective spirit of our nation.
