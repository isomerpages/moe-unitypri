## **Our Families**
The Primary 2 students learnt that families can be alike and different in many ways and that they can play a part in their community. They got to understand more about different jobs and businesses in a neighbourhood and how these provide income to provide for a familyâ€™s needs and wants. They even got a chance to be an entrepreneur and start their own business during the lessons! In all, they had lots of fun and laughter and brought home valuable lessons.
