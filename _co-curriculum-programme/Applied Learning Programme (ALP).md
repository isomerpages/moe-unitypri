Applied Learning Programme
==========================

EL Fest is part of the school’s Applied Learning Programme (ALP) and it aims to promote the joy of learning and inculcate a greater interest in the learning of the English Language. The students were treated to a repertoire of fun and exciting activities.

Teachers recommended books to the students via Book Buzz and students participated in the Charity Book Drive, Read for Books, organised by NLB.  EL Fest continued in the classrooms through language-centric activities like memory and bingo games for P1 and P2 levels while the P3 to P6 students engaged in boggles and charades. The EL Fest culminated with Storigami which involved teachers telling stories using origami.
