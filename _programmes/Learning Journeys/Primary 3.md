## **Kok Fah Technology Farm**
P3 students embarked on their learning journey to Kok Fah Technology Farm in Term 4 with much excitement and enthusiasm.  They saw how Singapore overcome its land scarcity with modern farming involving greenhouses and hydroponics. At various hands-on stations, students learned about hydroponics and its techniques as well as the significance of greenhouses. They did aloe vera gel extraction which they later incorporated into a refreshing drink.  Students enjoyed themselves as it was indeed an eye-opening and educational experience.
