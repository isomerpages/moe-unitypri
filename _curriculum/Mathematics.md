In Unity Primary School, we follow the MOE Mathematics Framework closely.  
The framework sets the direction for teaching, learning, and assessment practices in school.

### **<u>Key Programmes</u>**
##### **Broad-based Programmes:**
* Heuristic Booklet (P1 to P6)
* Brain Gym (P1 to P4)
* Speed Tests (P5 to P6)

##### **Customised Programmes:**
* Focused Remediation
* E2K Mathematics (P4 to P6)

##### **Engagement**
We emphasize on learning by doing. From concrete manipulatives and experiences, students are guided to uncover abstract mathematical concepts and results. Students engage in activities to explore and learn mathematical concepts and skills. We stress the use of C-P-A (Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract) in the learning of Mathematics. We strive to make learning of Mathematics fun, meaningful and relevant.
