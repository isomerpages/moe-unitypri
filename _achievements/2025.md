<h3><strong>National Public Speaking Competition</strong></h3>
<p>The National Public Speaking Competition (NPSC) is a premier contest for
students in the Primary and Secondary categories. Each year, contestants
test their skills against the nation’s top speakers, gaining invaluable
experience along the way. Now in its 12th year, the NPSC stands as one
of the country’s largest and most prestigious platforms for aspiring communicators
to shine..</p>
<p>This year, Patil Khyati Mayur from Primary 6F has raised the bar, clinching
1<sup>st</sup> place nationwide! She dazzled the audience with her poise
and eloquence, excelling in both the prepared and impromptu speech rounds.
Her composure during the impromptu segment, where she spoke on the challenging
topic “How would you comfort your friend if they lost a speech contest?”,
kept the judges and audience rapt with attention. Looking back on her journey
at UPS, she attributes her success to the rigorous training from the ELDD
Club and the dedicated guidance of the English Department teachers. Together,
they have nurtured in her resilience, determination and the courage to
rise to every challenge. Heartiest congratulations and kudos to her for
doing the school proud!</p>

<h3><strong>The Moo-O Awards 2025</strong></h3>
<p>The Singapore Moo-O Awards is a nation-wide digital storytelling competition
for Primary 2 students, celebrating their ability to read aloud expressively
in English Language through the Moo-O videos they create. The Awards aim
to inspire young learners to improve their reading skills and foster a
lifelong love for the English Language through a fun, engaging and immersive
reading experience.</p>
<p>Alayna Miasarah Binte Muhammad Yusof (2B), Nur Yasmin Binte Mohammed Helmi
(2D), and Lim Yu Chen (2E) did our school proud when they garnered a Bronze
Award at the recent Moo-O Awards 2025! In preparation for the competition,
the students dedicated many weeks to practising their pronunciation, intonation
and expression. They also worked closely with their teacher and peers to
refine their storytelling skills, demonstrating resilience and a positive
learning attitude throughout the process.</p>
<p>In doing so, they exemplified school values and 21st Century Competencies
(E21CC) of Communication, Collaboration and Information Skills, as they
effectively conveyed emotions through speech and worked as a team to produce
a captivating digital story. Keep up the good work, children!</p>
