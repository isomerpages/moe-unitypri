<h3><strong>Around the School &amp; Road Safety Walk</strong></h3>
<p>P1 Learning Journey Around the School Neighbourhood &amp; Road Safety
Walk was conducted for all P1 students in Term 1. The outing served to
help students understand the basic concepts of having safe behaviour while
being outdoors and when using the road.</p>
<p>With the support of Class Parent Volunteers and School Operation Managers,
the students together with their form teachers walked around the school
vicinity to familiarise themselves experientially with the traffic signals
at crossings and the road hazards they might encounter. The students also
stopped by at the nearby playgrounds where they learned safe and mindful
behaviour while having fun playing together.</p>
<p>The students had a wonderful time exploring around the school neighbourhood
with their classmates, teachers and parent volunteers even though it was
a rather warm morning. The fun, excitement and educational experience more
than made up for the humid weather!</p>

<h3><strong>Jacob Ballas</strong></h3>
<p>In the sixth week of Term 2, our young Primary 1 students set off on an
exciting Learning Journey to the Jacob Ballas Childrenâ€™s Garden, nestled
in the heart of the Singapore Botanic Gardens. This vibrant and interactive
space is thoughtfully designed to cater exclusively to the curious minds
of young learners.</p>
<p>During this enriching experience, our students delved into the wonders
of nature within an educational setting. They actively participated in
diverse activities at five different stations around the park, enabling
them to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Cultivate an understanding and appreciation for the natural world and
its diverse ecosystems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Acquire knowledge about plant life cycles, habitats, and the significance
of environmental conservation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spark curiosity and wonder through hands-on exploration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop teamwork and communication skills through collaborative group
activities.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, both students and teachers had a delightful and educational time,
immersing themselves in the beauty of nature.</p>

<h3><strong>River Wonders</strong></h3>
<p>On 2 October 2023, the P1 students went on a learning journey to the River
Wonders. A pre-learning journey lesson was conducted to introduce the various
zones and prepare the students for the trip.
<br>Together with the Form Teachers and Parent Volunteers, the students completed
different tasks assigned at the Mekong River, Giant Panda Forest and Amazon
Flooded Forest. The friendly and gentle manatees at the Amazon Flooded
Forest enthralled the students. They were equally excited to see the Electric
Eel, Piranha and Red Panda and in awe by the Giant Stingrays at the Mekong
River. The highlight of the visit was getting to see Kai Kai and Le Le
at the Panda Enclosure.
<br>Overall, the LJ was a huge success with the students learning about the
different animals and having a wonderful time bonding with one another.</p>
