<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Language Festival</u>
</p>
<p>Language Festival is part of the school’s Applied Learning Programme (ALP)
and it aims to promote the joy of learning and inculcate a greater interest
in the learning of the English Language. The students are treated to a
repertoire of fun and exciting activities. They immerse themselves in thoughtfully
designed activities that stretch their linguistic skills, broaden their
vocabulary, and deepen their understanding of language concepts in a fun
and meaningful way. Through “Excite, Engage, Express!” assembly programme,
they are given opportunities to showcase their creativity and public speaking
skills. There are also Author’s Talk and Author’s Forum where many students
get into deep engagement and meaningful discussions with the author.</p>
