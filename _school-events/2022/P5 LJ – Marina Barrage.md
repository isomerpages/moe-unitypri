Recently, the P5 students went on a learning journey to Marina Barrage, where they spent the afternoon learning more about environmental and sustainability topics such as climate, water, energy and waste. They also learnt the 3-in-1 function of the Barrage and got to watch how the crest gates work as a flood control measure, and explored the Sustainable Singapore Gallery. Some students shared that the highlight of the learning journey was the Augmented Reality (AR) Interactive Experience, where they got to enjoy and appreciate the marine life and coral reefs right before them!
