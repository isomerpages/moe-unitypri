### **Mother Tongue Language Curriculum and Aims**

The Mother Tongue Language (MTL) curriculum aims to inculcate in all our students 3 broad objectives in the teaching and learning of MTL:  
1. **Communication**&nbsp;– to develop proficient language users who can communicate in a confident, effective and meaningful way in real-life situations.
2. **Culture**&nbsp;– to nurture our students to understand and have a deeper appreciation for their culture and traditions associated with each MTL in our society.
3. **Connection**&nbsp;– to enable our students to connect with communities across Asia who speak and share the language and culture.

The Mother Tongue Department in UPS uses student-centered approach, which focuses on teaching MTL in a fun and interactive manner.  This will help students to be active and competent users of the language. Differentiated learning is adopted to cater to students with different learning profile and ability. This is to gradually build up students’ competency and understanding in the language. Teachers also incorporate E-pedagogy in their teaching and facilitation of learning, where students are introduced to different useful ICT learning tools and platforms for their MTL learning.

Different learning packages such as oral, composition and reading comprehension are designed by teachers to help students be equipped with essential language skills. Parents’ workshops are conducted by our teachers to keep parents abreast of the latest examination formats, understand assessment-answering techniques and share some useful and effective study tips to help their children at home.

### **<u>Key Programmes</u>**
##### **Mother Tongue Fortnight (Primary 1 to 6)**
The objective of the Mother Tongue Fortnight (MTFN) is to create an immersive environment that promotes the Joy of Learning &amp; an appreciation of the MTL. During the two consecutive weeks, a wide range of activities related to language and culture are conducted. These activities provide authentic opportunities for students to use their MTL and experience the culture.

##### **Cultural Performance Exposure Scheme**

As part of the Chinese Cultural Programme Exposure Scheme (CPES) held on 9 July 2025, our Primary 4 students were treated to a captivating performance of "Journey to the West - Trouble in Heaven" 《西游记之大闹天宫》at the Lee Kong Chian Reference Library. This theatrical production brought to life one of China's most beloved classical stories, offering students an immersive experience in traditional Chinese literature and mythology.

The performance skillfully portrayed the adventures of the mischievous Monkey King, Sun Wukong, as he created havoc in Heaven. Through dynamic storytelling and theatrical elements, students were introduced to classical Chinese characters and expressions in an engaging manner. The dramatic portrayal of this timeless tale kept them thoroughly engaged, creating memorable learning moments. 

Beyond expanding their Chinese vocabulary, students also gained valuable insights into traditional Chinese values and myths, making this experience both educational and entertaining. This enriching learning journey is yet another example of how cultural exposure can effectively enhance our students' appreciation of the Chinese Language and its literary traditions.

##### **Conversational Chinese and Malay Programme**
Conversational Chinese and Malay (CCM) is an enrichment programme offered to Primary 4 students to enable them to have some grounding of Chinese/Malay language and culture, other than their own Mother Tongue language. It aims to help students to learn to converse in daily activities and eventually allow them to pick up the language easily through increased social interaction with native speakers. 

##### **P5 Overseas Virtual Immersion Programme**
To promote the use of MTL in an authentic setting, selected P5 Chinese and Malay students participate in overseas virtual immersion programme to China and Brunei respectively. During the programme, students get the opportunity to virtually visit places of cultural and educational interest, carry out hands-on activities as well as interact with students from local schools.

##### **Mother Tongue Support Programme**
