### **Learning Journey to Singapore Discovery Centre**
The Primary 6 students went on a learning journey to the Singapore Discovery Centre (SDC) on 20 January 2023 where they experienced the Singapore Story from the past to the present via a multi-sensory approach.  Students had the opportunity to try out activities such as interactive videos and games at the various stations. One of the highlights was a video depicting Singapore’s past where students discovered how life was under extraordinary and challenging circumstances for people then. The students were self-directed and enthusiastic in completing the reflection booklet after exploring the different exhibits. Importantly, they learned how Singapore remained resilient with the foresight and resolve to face the future.  The entire experience was definitely an eye-opener for the students.

### **Race to Sustainability (Gardens by the Bay)**
Race to Sustainability at Gardens by the Bay is an annual event taken part by our P6 students. After a 2-year hiatus due to Covid-19 measures, Race to Sustainability returns in a format that differs from previous editions. Students have to make use of their IT skills and devices to navigate the clues and codes to solve tasks involving teamwork and their knowledge of green messages learnt in school and beyond.

The students not only enjoyed the outdoors, immersing themselves in the flora around Gardens by the Bay, they also took time to enjoy the company of the classmates and teachers in their last learning journey before graduating from Unity Primary School. To end off the learning journey, students undertook an Math and Science trail designed by our teachers where they put their skills into actions to solve puzzles such as calculating the area and height of the super trees, and learn about the threats faced by the vegetation in different parts of the world.

It was definitely an enriching and unforgettable experience for both the students and staff.

### **Learning Journey to Sungei Buloh**
Nothing beats going out into nature and observing animals in their habitat! That was what the P6 students experienced when they spent half their morning soaking in the sun to hike Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserves. They observed the diversity of living things forming the mangrove community and realized the importance of mangrove in the ecosystem. They were lucky to encounter the mudskippers in the muddy waters, the monitor lizards taking a dip in the pond and catching sights of some of the migratory birds grazing on the mudflats. The learning journey complemented the Science topics of Living Together and Adaptations which the students learnt in class. Students had much fun learning beyond the classroom.
