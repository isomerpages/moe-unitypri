# P2 LJ - River Wonders

#### Jun 28–Jul 6

After missing out on the opportunity to visit River Wonders due to COVID in 2021, the P2 students and teachers were elated to be able to embark on their LJ at the end of Term 2 this year when the SMMs were eased. All of them had a fascinating time seeing the actual animals which they saw on the virtual LJ last year. The sight of manatees and giant stingrays at the Amazon Flooded Forest enthralled the students. Many saw electric eel and piranha for the first time. The highlight of the visit was getting to see Jia Jia and Le Le at the panda enclosure. It was a sight to behold, with Le Le perched on the tree branch, enjoying his nap! Importantly, the classes had a wonderful time bonding with one another on their 1st ever LJ since they joined Unity Primary School at P1.
