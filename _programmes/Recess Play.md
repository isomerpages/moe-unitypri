<p>The school believes that providing the opportunity for structured as well as unstructured play amongst students help to encourage their development physically, emotionally, mentally, and socially. They can develop skills like self-monitoring, cooperation, communication, creativity etc, which are important executive functioning skills for students to be equipped with. Hence, the idea of weekly Recess Play has been mooted. Every Wednesday, several play areas will be set up for the students to play during the recesses. Some of the play activities include origami, board games, storytelling, soccer and skipping. Students can make the choice to select the activity which they are interested to participate in. Recess Play started in 2023 and has been well-received by the students. With the support of many dedicated Parent Volunteers, the implementation of Recess Play has been doing well. It is really heartening to see parents coming on board to help and play a part in making school fun for the students. Thank you, Parent Volunteers!</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Programmes/2023/2023%20recess%20play.jpg"></div><p></p>
