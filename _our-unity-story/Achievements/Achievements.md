**West Zone Junior Science Whiz Challenge (JSWC): Inter-Primary School Science Quiz 2022**
![](/images/Achievements.png)
West Zone Junior Science Whiz Challenge is organized by the River Valley High School annually to instill interest in the quest for knowledge in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) in Primary 6 pupils and provide an opportunity for students from different schools to constructively challenge one another at a common platform.

The theme of the Challenge this year is “Innovation – a Necessity.” The astronomical pace at which science and technology have advanced cannot be isolated from humanity’s thirst for innovation. From the light bulb to smartphones – these creations are our desires to bring about progress of mankind. These inventions which originate from a spark in the mind are not only innovations put into practice but also bold ideas which have changed the world.  We are proud of our students, Aiden Tan Yee Chen, Dhanekula Gnana Manaswith and Ng Yu Chen, for doing well in the preliminary test round and clinching the second runner up in the Grand Final stage.  Kudos!
