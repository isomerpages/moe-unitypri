# P1 LJ - Jacob Ballas Children's Garden

#### May 17–Jul 8

P1 students went on a Learning Journey to the Jacob Ballas Children’s Garden sometime in April of Term 2. To complement the nurturing of the value of responsibility, students were taught the traits of being responsible visitors and safety practices while being outdoors. Students also learned key competencies like self-awareness & self-management. 

A pre-learning journey lesson was conducted to prepare students for their trip. With the help of Parent Volunteers, students together with their Form Teachers were tasked to find 5 stations at the garden and complete various activities such as finding edible plants in the garden and their way out of a maze. 

Even in the hot weather, students thoroughly enjoyed themselves exclaiming the day as “The best day of their life!” Overall, it was a meaningful and beneficial experience for the students and one that we hope will evoke in them the love for the environment.
