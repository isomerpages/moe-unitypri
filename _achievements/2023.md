### **National Public Speaking Competition 2023**
![](/images/Achievements/2023/national%20speech%20acheivement.png)
The National Public Speaking Competition is a public speaking contest for students in the Primary and Secondary categories (by age group). Contestants get to experience the challenge of competing against the best speakers at the National level. The NPSC is currently into its 10th year of running (after the COVID-19 period).

This year, Afruz Salih from 5G has done our school proud by emerging a finalist (10th place) in the Grand Finals held at the Young Men Christian’s Association headquarters. This was no mean feat as there were two components to the Grand Finals. Afruz had to both present a prepared speech while also being mentally agile and confident enough to give an impromptu speech on the topic of kindness! Indeed, Afruz was ecstatic to be placed as the 10th finalist out of the 13 students nationally who made it to the Grand Finals. Let’s look forward to more great speeches from our budding speakers in future competitions!

Hurray Unity!
