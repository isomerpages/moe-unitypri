## **Green Means Cool**
The Junior Achievement (JA) Programme serves to provide opportunities and inspire our students to learn a range of age-appropriate soft skills experientially to contribute to the vitality of their community.

Through the two-day programme, the Primary 5 students have learnt what causes global warming and climate change. Students also have come up with practical and personal steps that they can take to ensure a more sustainable lifestyle to reduce their carbon footprint. In all, the students have a better understanding that they have a part to play in saving and protecting the Earth.
