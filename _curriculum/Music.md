In UPS, we believe that music, alongside visual art and physical education, is an important part of every child’s holistic education. Hence, all our music programmes are geared toward providing our students plenty of opportunities to explore, develop and share their music talents and skills.

The goal of the Music Department is to promote, encourage and develop the love for music-making amongst students through engaging, challenging and fun-loving activities, in line with the standards set by the General Music Programme Syllabus.

The Music Department hopes that every student shall be able to confidently sing, play instrument, and appreciate music through dance and movement activities. Every music lesson shall be a celebration of students’ effort, creativity, and artistry. Every one shall be able to support and show care for one another, lifting each other up to achieve synergy, harmony and unity.

### **<u>Key Programmes</u>**

To ensure all students have good foundation in music, our learning outcomes are organised around overarching Learning Objectives (LO).

Our students learn these LO in an integrative manner, where elements and concepts are discovered sequentially through active musical experiences.

Our P1 and P2 students learn music foundation through singing activities, musical games, movement and non-pitched percussion instruments.

Our P3 to P6 students are offered opportunities to learn to play musical instruments such as recorder, xylophone and cajon.

Aside from various music experiences in the classroom, all students are also encouraged to showcase their talents during school events such as National Day, Teachers’ Day and for the P6 students during their Graduation Day.

##### **Unity Got Talent**
Unity’s Got Talent was started in 2020 to provide students with opportunities to hone, express and share their talents. Through the experience, it inculcates school values and an appreciation and gratitude to the school. From singing to playing musical instruments, to dancing and doing different tricks and challenges, students step up by auditioning, rehearsing and performing during Teacher’s Day – a tribute concert for our teachers. It is an event that both the teachers and students anticipate where students prove that they have the talent and heart for their teachers.
