### **Outdoor Education Learning Journey**
P4 level students had a fantastic experience during the recent Outdoor Education Learning Journey to Limbang Park. The adventure in the outdoor setting provided numerous opportunities for learning, fun, and appreciation of nature.
Armed with their new PE Journal, they eagerly embarked on a quest to draw their experience maps. In another activity, the young learners connected with nature in a unique way through observing the unique trees at the park. They learned about parasitic plants living on the host trees and the characteristics of the different trees. Students explored the neighbourhood outdoor nature parks to increase their awareness of the green spaces in the community and develop their skills in a big classroom unlike any other - full of wonder, discovery, and endless lessons waiting to be learned.

As responsible adventurers, the students learned the importance of packing a healthy snack for their outdoor journey. Before setting off, they thoughtfully prepared a variety of nutritious treats, including fresh fruits, whole-grain sandwiches, and energy-boosting nuts. Their willingness to make mindful food choices was commendable. Our students showed exemplary responsibility by ensuring they kept their hands clean before eating. Knowing the importance of maintaining personal hygiene, especially when enjoying the great outdoors, the students used hand sanitizers and wipes to stay fresh and germ-free while relishing their healthy snacks. 

Our students embraced the opportunity to connect with nature to nurture their minds and bodies as well as learn valuable life skills.  The Outdoor Education Learning Journey to Limbang Park was undoubtedly a huge success.

### **Museum Based Learning**
The Primary 4 Museum-Based Learning Journey to the National Gallery of Singapore in February 2025 was an exciting and immersive experience that brought art to life! As part of the refreshed art education syllabus, this experience gave students the opportunity to explore Singapore’s rich artistic heritage in a fun and authentic way.<br>
Students were thrilled to learn about local pioneer artists like Georgette Chen and Tay Boon Pin, who opened their eyes to the world of portraits and how early “selfies” captured not just appearances, but emotions and identities. <br>
They also ventured into the fascinating world of sculptures, discovering how artist Shui Tit Sing’s works told powerful stories through his choice of materials. The sculptures “Long House” and “Life of Miao” left the students in awe as they uncovered the meanings  and histories behind these amazing artworks.<br>
The students learnt history through art when they saw how Chua Mia Tee’s "National Language Class" and Lim Hak Tai’s "Riot" showed important moments in Singapore’s past. This helped them understand how art tells powerful stories about who we are and where we come from.<br>
This trip to the museum has definitely helped students gain a deeper appreciation for both Singapore’s art and history, leaving them with joyful memories of how creativity connects to culture. It was a meaningful and creative experience that showed them how learning about Singapore’s heritage can be both educational and fun.

### **Geylang Serai Heritage Gallery**
During the recent learning journey to the Geylang Serai Heritage Gallery, the Primary 4 students had the opportunity to play the role of explorers. They went on a mission to discover the history of Geylang Serai and its importance to the Malay and Muslim communities in Singapore. The students explored the gallery and visited four different stations, each with friendly educators who told stories and showed interesting objects to make history come alive.
This year, there was an additional segment of Precinct walk to the Geylang Serai market. The students were enthralled by the lively atmosphere as the market was abuzz with activities from the various Malay, Indian and Chinese food stalls. They also got to observe the different Malay traditional clothes being sold and the colourful stalls filled with aromatic spices.

All in all, the students had an exhilarating and enriching experience, gaining insights into the history of Geylang Serai and its pivotal role in the Malay and Muslim communities.

### **Kreta Ayer Heritage Gallery**
The learning journey to Kreta Ayer Heritage Gallery started with a short walk around the Chinatown Complex and Sago Lane precinct. The museum guides introduced us to the culture and heritage of the surrounding places. Since our visit coincided with the Mooncake Festival, the students visited a traditional mooncake bakery showcasing traditional mooncakes and old-styled lanterns. <br>
In the Heritage Gallery, students learned about the history and heritage of Kreta Ayer, Chinese culture, and the contributions of Chinese and Chinese communities to Singapore.  The exhibits on Chinese puppetry intrigued the students, and they learned more about how this art form was used to tell stories. The students were also engaged in many hands-on activities, such as playing Chinese instruments and calligraphy. Through the pictures, stories, and community collections, the learning was enriched with the heritage of Chinatown and its evolution from the olden days to contemporary times. It was an enriching experience and an eye-opener for the students to learn about Chinese culture.

### **MTL Chinese Cultural Programme Exposure Scheme (CPES)**
The Chinese Cultural Programme Exposure Scheme (CPES) is an initiative designed to enhance the students' learning of Chinese Language through immersive cultural experiences. By exposing students to captivating and related cultural performances presented by both local and international arts groups, CPES aims to cultivate a deeper appreciation for Chinese Language and its culture.<br>
This year, our P4 students attended a live performance entitled "Mr. Smart" 《聪明先生》, presented by Arts Theatre Pte Ltd at Stamford Arts Centre Black Box Theatre on Wednesday, 31 July. The engaging performance provided students with a unique opportunity to learn more about Chinese idioms and folklore in a fun and interactive way.<br>
As the performance was filled with witty dialogues and humorous situations, it kept our students entertained throughout. The interactive elements allowing students to engage with the performers further enhanced the learning experience.  The students not only expanded their vocabulary but also gained a deeper understanding of Chinese culture and traditions.<br>
Indeed the learning journey was a resounding success, demonstrating the power of cultural experiences in fostering a love for the learning of Chinese Language.
