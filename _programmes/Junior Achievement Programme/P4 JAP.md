### **Our Community**
The P4 students learnt to recognise how people contribute to and benefit from a community such as understanding what taxes are and how taxation supports government services. Students also gained exposure to the different career choices and types of skills each of these jobs requires.  They even have had the opportunity to apply innovation to a production process â€“ coming up with an exclusive donut for sale!  In all, the students have found the lessons engaging and the experience meaningful.
