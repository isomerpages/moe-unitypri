<h3><strong>Home-Based Learning (HBL)</strong></h3>
<p>Home-Based Learning (HBL) will be conducted once this academic year.</p>
<p>This HBL exercise is necessary to prepare students for continuity of learning
in the event of school closure due to unforeseen circumstances. It ensures
that students are familiar with online learning platforms and procedures,
and are able to transit smoothly to home-based learning when required.</p>
<p>On the designated day, students are required to attend their Form Teacher
Guidance Period (FTGP) via Google Meet, which can be accessed through the
Student Learning Space.</p>
<p>In addition, subject teachers may assign homework for students to complete.
These assignments may be in online or offline formats.</p>
<p>Detailed instructions will be provided to students by their Form Teachers
prior to the HBL day.</p>
<p>Through this HBL experience, students are encouraged to take ownership
of their learning and develop self-directed learning habits.</p>
<p>HBL dates for 2026 are as shown in the table below:</p>
