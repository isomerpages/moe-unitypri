##### **Cyber Wellness Programme**

In Unity Primary School, our Cyber Wellness (CW) programme, guided by MOE CW Framework, focuses on developing students’ instincts to protect and empower themselves to be responsible for their own well-being in cyberspace. 

The 3 guiding principles of CW are:

*   Respect for Self and Others
*   Safe & Responsible Use
*   Positive Peer Influence

##### **Cyber Wellness Topics :**

*   P1 – Netiquette
*   P2 – Cyberbullying
*   P3 – Danger with Cyber Contacts
*   P4 – Addiction – Managing Screen Time
*   P5 – Copyright
*   P6 – Handling Inappropriate Content – Scams & Spam

In our continuous effort to advocate Cyber Wellness, our very own CW Mascot was launched on 14 Feb 22.  The CW Mascot named Captain UnITrone (yoU aNd I Together Respect Online Navigation & Etiquette), together with the CW Student Ambassadors and all students of UPS, will champion the school’s efforts in promoting and advocating good netiquette and appropriate online behaviour at all times.

##### **Cyber Wellness Student Ambassadors (CWSAs)**
The roles of Cyber Wellness Student Ambassadors are very important as they help to ensure that the rules of netiquette are followed in online learning portals, which includes SLS.  Selected Cyber Wellness Student Ambassadors will attend the Cyber Wellness Ambassador Conference every year.  After the conference, they used the skills learnt and collaborate to design activities for the school’s Outreach Programme by focusing on Cyber Wellness, such as Cyber Safety.  Some of the activities designed by them include games and ICT quizzes to engage their peers during recess.

##### **Code for Fun (CFF)**
Our P5 cohort will be attending a coding enrichment programme called Code for Fun. This is a 10-hour programme that is conducted by Ministry of Education (MOE) and the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA). 

Through this programme, we hope to achieve the following desired outcomes for our students:
1. Develop an appreciation of core computational thinking and coding concepts through simple visual programming-based lessons.
2. Expose to emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and Cyber Security.
