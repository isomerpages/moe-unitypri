<p>Successful family-school partnerships in alignment with school goals can result in improved educational outcomes and student wellbeing.</p><p>Parents can become integral partners of the school by becoming Parent Volunteers (PV). There are many merits in being a PV. By being present and assisting in school programmes &amp; events creates valuable opportunities for you &amp; your children to have conversations on common matters such as School Activities, Learning &amp; Teacher-Student/Peer Relationships. It can foster closer family connection and better understanding of the school, its purpose and what goes on in your childâ€™s school life.</p><p>We invite interested parents to join us on this amazing journey of joint collaboration. Show your support by volunteering for the varied programmes to support the holistic development of the students. You have a choice to volunteer for weekly or ad-hoc programmes as shown below.</p><table><tbody><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Weekly Commitment</p></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Event Based</p></th></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Library Assistant (Weekdays)</strong></p><p>Assist the school librarian during recesses.</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Events/Festive Celebrations during Recesses</strong></p><p>Supervise students when they are participating in activities during recesses e.g. International Friendship Day, Hari Raya, Deepavali, Language Fest etc.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Safety Ambassador for Recess Play</strong></p><p>Supervise the students when they are playing during recesses.</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Chaperones for Learning Journeys</strong></p><p>Assist Form Teachers to supervise students during the learning journeys.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>If you are keen to be a PV or have any queries, feel free to email Mrs Veronica Tan (Year Head/Middle Primary) at veronica_tan_siew_lan@schools.gov.sg or contact her at 67676750.</p><p>We strongly believe that you will find volunteering in UPS an enriching and meaningful experience.
