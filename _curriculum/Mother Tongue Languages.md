### **Mother Tongue Language Curriculum and Aims**

The Mother Tongue Language (MTL) curriculum aims to inculcate in all our students 3 broad objectives in the teaching and learning of MTL:  
1. **Communication**&nbsp;– to develop proficient language users who can communicate in a confident, effective and meaningful way in real-life situations.
2. **Culture**&nbsp;– to nurture our students to understand and have a deeper appreciation for their culture and traditions associated with each MTL in our society.
3. **Connection**&nbsp;– to enable our students to connect with communities across Asia who speak and share the language and culture.

The Mother Tongue Department in UPS uses student-centered approach, which focuses on teaching MTL in a fun and interactive manner.  This will help students to be active and competent users of the language. Differentiated learning is adopted to cater to students with different learning profile and ability. This is to gradually build up students’ competency and understanding in the language. Teachers also incorporate E-pedagogy in their teaching and facilitation of learning, where students are introduced to different useful ICT learning tools and platforms for their MTL learning.

Different learning packages such as oral, composition and reading comprehension are designed by teachers to help students be equipped with essential language skills. Parents’ workshops are conducted by our teachers to keep parents abreast of the latest examination formats, understand assessment-answering techniques and share some useful and effective study tips to help their children at home.

### **<u>Key Programmes</u>**
##### **Mother Tongue Fortnight (Primary 1 to 6)**
The objective of the Mother Tongue Fortnight (MTFN) is to create an immersive environment that promotes the Joy of Learning &amp; an appreciation of the MTL. During the two consecutive weeks, a wide range of activities related to language and culture are conducted. These activities provide authentic opportunities for students to use their MTL and experience the culture.

##### **Cultural Performance Exposure Scheme**

The Cultural Programme Exposure Scheme (CPES) is an initiative to promote Chinese Language (CL) learning in students and aims to expose students to CL-related cultural performances by local and foreign performing arts groups.
After a 3-year hiatus, we were finally able to take our students to Victoria Theatre to watch a live performance on Wed, 5 Apr this year. P4CL students watched a Chinese children drama “Kiki and Her Magical Stories 2” 《小魔女的童话故事》by the Arts Theatre Pte Ltd. Our students and teachers enjoyed the learning journey tremendously, especially it being their first outdoor learning journey since the pandemic struck. The performance was very interesting and students enjoyed the interaction with the actors during the performance. 


##### **Conversational Chinese and Malay Programme**
Conversational Chinese and Malay (CCM) is an enrichment programme offered to Primary 4 students to enable them to have some grounding of Chinese/Malay language and culture, other than their own Mother Tongue language. It aims to help students to learn to converse in daily activities and eventually allow them to pick up the language easily through increased social interaction with native speakers. 

##### **P5 Overseas Virtual Immersion Programme**
To promote the use of MTL in an authentic setting, selected P5 Chinese and Malay students participate in overseas virtual immersion programme to China and Brunei respectively. During the programme, students get the opportunity to virtually visit places of cultural and educational interest, carry out hands-on activities as well as interact with students from local schools.

##### **MTL Ambassadors Programme**
MTL students who shows interest and talent in specific areas are stretched through enrichment activities such as CL Cross Talk and Rakan Bahasa. They also represent the school in external competitions such as Cepat Tepat Kuiz, Creative Writing and Oratorical Competition to help them fulfil their potential in the language. 

##### **Mother Tongue Support Programme**
Primary 3 and 4 students who require additional support in learning MTL are placed under the Mother Tongue Support Programme (MTSP). MTSP is a customised programme where students get more individualised attention while more opportunities are provided to use MTL to experience success in varying degrees.
