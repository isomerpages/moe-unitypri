Successful family-school partnerships in alignment with school goals can result in improved educational outcomes and student wellbeing. 

Parents can become integral partners of the school by becoming Parent Volunteers (PV).  There are many merits in being a PV.  By being present and assisting in school programmes & events creates valuable opportunities for you & your children to have conversations on common matters such as School Activities, Learning & Teacher-Student/Peer Relationships. It can foster closer family connection and better understanding of the school, its purpose and what goes on in your childâ€™s school life.

We invite interested parents to join us on this amazing journey of joint collaboration.  Show your support by volunteering for the varied programmes to support the holistic development of the students. You have a choice to volunteer for weekly or ad-hoc programmes as shown below.

If you are keen to be a PV or have any queries, feel free to email Mrs Veronica Tan (Year Head/Middle Primary) at veronica_tan_siew_lan@schools.gov.sg or contact her at 67676750.

We strongly believe that you will find volunteering in UPS an enriching and meaningful experience. Together we can make learning in UPS a wonderful experience for the students.

We would also like to thank the Parent Volunteers who have come forward to provide their help and support in 2022. Without you, the students would not have such an enriching and happy time taking part in the various school programmes in 2022. Thank you very much, Parent Volunteers!
