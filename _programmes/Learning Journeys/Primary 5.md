## **Indian Heritage Centre**
The P5 students went on a learning journey to the Indian Heritage Centre to better understand the culture and heritage of Singaporeâ€™s Indian community. They travelled back in time, to learn how the immigrants arrived in Singapore from the Indian subcontinent and became part of our social fabric. The Indian community influenced and helped to shape our multi-cultural, multi-racial island nation. Students enjoyed themselves thoroughly at the Indian Heritage Centre in the heart of Little India as they explored the various galleries learning more about the food, spices, business, performing arts and architecture of one of the major ethnic communities in Singapore.
