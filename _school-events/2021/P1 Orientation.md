# P1 Orientation

#### Jan 4â€“Aug 16, 2021

The first day of school for P1 began on Monday, 4 January with the rest of the P2 to P6 students reporting on Tuesday, 5 January. 1st week was devoted to P1 Orientation so that the little ones could assimilate to the environment, classmates, teachers and school routines. Despite the COVID measures, a parent of each P1 student had the opportunity to observe their children during recess. In the classrooms, our new students bonded with their new classmates and teachers through various class activities and school tour. It was indeed a meaningful week of learning for the Primary 1 students. Good job!
