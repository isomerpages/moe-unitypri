The journey began with a visit to the Istana Nurul Iman, the official residence of the Sultan of Brunei. 
Even though the group did not enter the palace, the visit to the main gate provided valuable insights into Brunei's royal traditions and the importance of Istana Nurul Iman in the country's identity. This was followed by a visit to the Omar Ali Saifuddien Mosque, renowned for its stunning architecture and serene atmosphere, allowing students to appreciate the beauty of Islamic design.

On Day 2, the group visited Sekolah Tunas Jaya PGGB Lambak, where students attended lessons and participated in a lively Zumba session as well as various co-curricular activities. They enjoyed a captivating performance showcasing the seven dance tribes of Brunei and, in turn, presented a dance reflecting Singapore's multicultural heritage. The day continued with a visit to the Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah Calligraphy Centre, where students engaged in Arabic calligraphy and purchased unique souvenirs. They then explored Kampong Ayer, the famous water village, where they visited a local home and indulged in traditional Bruneian delicacies, gaining insights into the unique lifestyle of the water community.

On Day 3, students travelled to Kilang Sagu Kampong Ukong, the only sago-producing factory in Brunei. Here, they learned about the intricate process of making ambulung, an essential ingredient for ambuyat, Brunei's national dish. The itinerary also included visits to the Billionth Barrel Monument where students learned about the significance of oil production to Brunei's economy, commemorating the production of the billionth barrel of oil from the Seria oil field. At the Royal Regalia Museum, students explored exhibits showcasing the royal regalia used during ceremonial occasions, including crowns, swords, and ceremonial attire. They learned about the significance of these items in Bruneian culture and their reflection of the nation’s traditions and values.

They were awed by its stunning architecture and intricate design, learning about the mosque's significance as a place of worship and community gathering. The visit to the Brunei Energy Hub before heading back to Singapore was a significant highlight of the immersion programme, deepening students' understanding of the oil and gas sector while fostering a sense of responsibility towards sustainable energy practices.

Reflecting on their experiences, our students shared how much they enjoyed immersing themselves in Brunei’s culture and environment. They spoke of the warm welcome they received at the Bruneian school, the engaging lessons, and the opportunity to connect with local peers. Many found the visit to the sago factory and learning about the making of ambuyat to be a fascinating hands-on experience. They also appreciated the friendliness of the locals, the unique exploration of Kampong Ayer with its local pastries, and the joy of participating in a calligraphy session where they learned to write in Arabic and took home special souvenirs. The trip was truly filled with meaningful interactions and valuable cultural insights. 

Overall, the Overseas Immersion Programme to Brunei was a successful endeavour that fostered cultural exchange and understanding while creating lasting memories for the students involved. The combination of educational visits, cultural experiences, and personal reflections contributed to a deeper appreciation of Bruneian traditions and the importance of cross-cultural connections.

### **2023**
The school organised a Virtual Overseas Immersion Programme (VOIP) to Brunei for 34 identified P5 Malay Language students on Wed, 8 Mar 2023 (Part 1)  and Wed, 20 Sep 2023 (Part 2) with the following objectives:

* To expose students to the culture of Brunei School through virtual interaction with the school students
* To provide opportunities for students to develop their communication skills in Malay Language (ML)
* To inculcate the appreciation of Brunei culture in an experiential manner
* To promote cross-cultural sensitivity & understanding in our students by having the opportunity to experience being student ambassadors of Singapore. 

On 8 March 2023, the students were brought on a tour to the outskirts of Omar Ali Saifuddien Mosque and Kampong Ayer. The livestream video experience with the tour guide was interactive to keep the students immersed with the virtual reality setting. The students asked questions about Brunei and learned the way of life of the people living in Kampong Ayer. It was fascinating for the students to understand the self-sufficiency of Kampong Ayer with accessibilities to a floating hospital, police post and a fire station despite being far away from the mainland. 

The students learned the techniques of basket weaving and afterwards, put on their creative hats to produce their very own original patterns showing resilience, skill, concentration, and patience throughout the activities. They also attempted Brunei batik painting and different techniques used in Brunei’s batik like marbling, airbrushing, and sprinkling, uniquely different from those in Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia. 

The highly anticipated activity was the school interaction between our students and students from Sekolah Tunas Jaya PGGMB Lambak. Conducted on 20 September 2023, the session provided opportunities for our students to enhance their use of the Malay Language authentically. They shared about the subjects and programmes offered by UPS and the places of interest, food and festivals in Singapore.

Needless to say, the students thoroughly enjoyed the VOIP to Brunei Darussalam.
