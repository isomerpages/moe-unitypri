<h3><strong>Home-Based Learning (HBL)</strong></h3>
<p>Home-Based Learning (HBL) exercises will be conducted in every academic
year.&nbsp; For each HBL exercise, students will be assigned with both
online and offline assignments.</p>
<p>School will keep parents informed of the HBL schedule for each exercise
via Parents Gateway (PG). This will allow parents to play a complementary
role by helping to monitor the progress of their children’s learning in
terms of work completion.</p>
<p>As for the students, the HBL schedule will be shared with them via Student
Learning Space (SLS) to encourage them to exercise responsibility for their
own learning and to be self-directed learners.</p>
<p>HBL dates for 2024 are as shown in the table below:</p>
