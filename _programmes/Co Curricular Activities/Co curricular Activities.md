<p>The Co-Curriculum is integral to the holistic development of students.
Through the Co-Curriculum, students are provided with varied and authentic
opportunities to develop character and competencies that are specific to
the programmes. Learning includes core values, social-emotional competencies
and the emerging 21st Century Competencies (21CC).</p>
<p>One of the Co-Curriculum Programme provided by the school is the Co-Curricular
Activities (CCA). The school’s CCA focuses on development of specific knowledge,
skills and values based on the student’s choice of CCA. The CCA enables
students to discover their interests and talents while providing a platform
for friendships and social integration of students from diverse backgrounds.
Well-organised and implemented, they fuel in the student a life-long love
for a particular activity, be it a sport or a musical pursuit. This helps
the student to lead a balanced life in adulthood.</p>
