<h3><strong>Around the School &amp; Road Safety Walk</strong></h3>
<p>As part of their first Learning Journey, our Primary 1 students venture
around the school’s neighbourhood to learn about road safety and being
responsible members of the community.</p>
<p>Guided by teachers, parent volunteers, and school staff, students identify
road signs, practise safe crossing techniques and learn how to use public
spaces respectfully. A short playtime at a nearby playground gives them
the chance to apply what they’ve learned about care and consideration in
shared spaces.</p>
<p>It is a meaningful experience that equips our young learners with important
life skills while helping them feel more connected to the world around
them.</p>

<h3><strong>Jacob Ballas Children's Garden</strong></h3>
<p>A highlight of the year is the visit to the Jacob Ballas Children’s Garden,
an outdoor classroom designed just for children. Here, students explore
the natural world through hands-on activities across various learning stations.</p>
<p>They discover plant life cycles, habitats, and the importance of caring
for the environment, all while developing teamwork and a sense of wonder.
In the event of wet weather, students participate in a specially designed
e-learning version, ensuring that learning continues meaningfully.</p>
<p>Whether outdoors or in class, this journey deepens their appreciation
for nature in fun and memorable ways.</p>

<h3><strong>River Wonders</strong></h3>
<p>At the end of the year, students head to River Wonders to explore the
amazing diversity of wildlife. A pre-trip lesson helps them learn about
the zones and animals they will see, setting the stage for deeper engagement.</p>
<p>During the trip, students are captivated by the Manatees, Electric Eel,
Red Panda, Giant Stingrays, and more. Of course, the highlight is always
spotting the beloved pandas, Jia Jia and Kai Kai!</p>
<p>This journey not only enhances their knowledge of animals and habitats
but also brings classmates closer as they learn and explore together.</p>
