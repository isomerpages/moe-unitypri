withdrawals from your child’s Edusave Fund to pay for approved fees and
local enrichment programmes. The one-time Edusave withdrawal authorisation
will remain valid throughout your child’s school years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The school will continue to seek your consent for your child’s participation
in our planned programmes for the year, without which no Edusave withdrawals
will be made.</p>
