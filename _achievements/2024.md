<h3><strong>Project E.C.O (Educate. Challenge. Organise) GOLD Award</strong></h3><p>The team embarked on a 6-month-long project, dedicating their efforts to heighten dengue prevention awareness in both the school and the community, with the aim of reducing dengue cases in the neighbourhood.</p><p>Executing a two-tier strategy, the team first created a dengue prevention video from scratch, involving their school mascot. The video was shared during the school-wide assembly session, where the team reiterated the importance of collective efforts in dengue prevention. They also set up various environmental booths during the annual Science &amp; Green Carnival to engage their peers in dengue prevention and environmental conservation through games, quizzes, and flyers.</p><p>To extend their reach to the community, the team designed post cards and distributed them to residents during the annual Estate Collection Day. Partnering PCF kindergarten, door-to-door visits were also conducted to educate residents on B-L-O-C-K steps. The project had heightened awareness in residents to take dengue preventive measures.</p><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Achievements/Untitled_23.png"></div><p><a href="https://www.cgs.gov.sg/what-we-do/cgs2023/eco-schools/public-health-primary-school" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Unity Primary featured on Clean &amp; Clean Singapore Website</a></p><p></p>
