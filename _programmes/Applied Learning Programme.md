<h4><strong>English Language</strong></h4>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Language Festival</u>
</p>
<p>Language Festival is part of the school’s Applied Learning Programme (ALP)
and it aims to promote the joy of learning and inculcate a greater interest
in the learning of the English Language. The students are treated to a
repertoire of fun and exciting activities. They immerse themselves in thoughtfully
designed activities that stretch their linguistic skills, broaden their
vocabulary, and deepen their understanding of language concepts in a fun
and meaningful way. Through “Excite, Engage, Express!” assembly programme,
they are given opportunities to showcase their creativity and public speaking
skills. There are also Author’s Talk and Author’s Forum where many students
get into deep engagement and meaningful discussions with the author.</p>

<p>Back in their classrooms, students take part in a range of engaging language
activities, including Bingo, Charade, Jeopardy, Blind Artist, card games,
board games and word games. These fun-filled sessions make English learning
enjoyable while enriching their understanding and appreciation of the language.&nbsp;
At the end of the event, students experience Storigami guided by teachers
telling stories using origami and participate in the Charity Book Drive,
Read for Books, organised by National Library Board (NLB).</p>

<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Enrichment Programme</u>
</p>
<p>The EL Enrichment Programme in UPS aims to expose students to learning
beyond the curriculum. Varied learning opportunities across levels are
planned for students throughout their years in UPS. All students engage
in a range of activities that provide opportunities for them to perform
confidently, think critically and communicate effectively in front of adult
audiences in addition to their schoolmates.</p>

<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>&nbsp;R.A.B.B.I.T</u>
</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>Read A Book Because It’s Terrific! (R.A.B.B.I.T)</strong>&nbsp;programme
was introduced in 2014 as part of the school’s Applied Learning Programme
(ALP). R.A.B.B.I.T encourages students to read a wide variety of books
from different sources and think critically about what they have read.</p>
<p>Students can look forward to the latest book reviews with NLB, a meet-and-greet
with a local author, or even the termly mass borrowing. In-house activities
provide in-depth knowledge about books as they learn about the novelisation
of their favourite movies such as The Cat in the Hat by Dr. Seuss or The
Midnight Gang by David Walliams.</p>
