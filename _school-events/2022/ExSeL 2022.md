Our approach to student leadership development is steered by our school’s philosophy of ‘Everyone Matters’ and anchored on a set of core values. We believe that every student can be a leader and leadership development should be intentional. We provide leadership trainings and learning opportunities for our students to attain the desired student outcomes of Passionate & Self-Directed Learner, Resilient & All-Rounded Individual, Concerned & Active Citizen. 

On top of the termly baseline leadership and student leadership training workshops, we conduct an annual Experiential Learning for Student Leaders (ExSeL). This year, ExSeL was held on 14 March, the first day of March Holidays. The programme aims to provide a platform for selected Student Leaders to undergo leadership development via authentic and experiential learning, so that they are able to apply and appreciate the Five Principles of Kouzes Leadership Challenge and live out our school values. 

Student Leaders were challenged to complete a series of games such as ‘drawing twins’, ‘home run’, ‘giant’s gum ball’ and ‘lead the blind mouse’ in groups. These age-appropriate teambuilding games catered to our student leaders’ learning needs and helped to instil school values and build leadership skills in them. Student Leaders were given the opportunities to discover and learn about themselves through hands-on activities. 

We were also pleased to have our Alumni to join us to share their leadership experiences in UPS and how that had honed them to be better leaders and helped them in their secondary school life. 

The day ended with the Student Leaders reflecting on their learning and being recognised for their hard effort put in during the day. In a nutshell as expressed by many of the student leaders, ExSeL was a fun, meaningful and engaging day for them.
