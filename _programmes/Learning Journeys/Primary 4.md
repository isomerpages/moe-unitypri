### **Outdoor Education Learning Journey**
P4 students had a fantastic experience during the recent Outdoor Education Learning Journey to Limbang Park. The adventure in the outdoor setting provided numerous opportunities for learning, fun, and appreciation of the nature.
The students put their navigational skills learned during PE lessons to the test. Armed with simple maps, they eagerly embarked on a quest to find checkpoints around the park. Witnessing their teamwork and excitement as they searched for these checkpoints was truly heartwarming. The students proved to be adept at navigating the park, demonstrating impressive problem-solving, teamwork and orientation abilities. During the next activity of leaf and bark rubbing activity, the young learners connected with nature in a unique way. Equipped with paper and color pencils, they explored the park's diverse flora, capturing the intricate patterns of leaves and bark on their learning sheets. It was a delightful sight to see their faces light up as they discovered the different textures and patterns present in nature. 
This activity not only fostered creativity but also instilled in them a profound appreciation for the natural beauty surrounding them in their own neighbourhood. As responsible adventurers, the students learned the importance of packing a healthy snack for their outdoor journey. Before setting off, they thoughtfully prepared a variety of nutritious treats, including fresh fruits, whole-grain sandwiches, and energy-boosting nuts. Their willingness to make mindful food choices was commendable. The students showed exemplary responsibility by maintaining personal hygiene and ensuring they kept their hands clean before eating. They used hand sanitizers and wipes to stay fresh and germ-free while relishing their healthy snacks. 
The Outdoor Education Learning Journey to Limbang Park was undoubtedly a huge success. Our students embraced the opportunity to connect with nature to nurture their minds and bodies and learn valuable life skills.  Studentsâ€™ awareness of the green spaces in the community was heightened together with the development of skills in a big classroom unlike any other - full of wonder, discovery, and endless lessons waiting to be learned.

MBL encourages critical thinking and inquiry-based learning. Students are prompted to ask questions, analyze information, and draw their own conclusions as they interact with exhibits and displays.

MBL not only cultivate interest but also lifelong learners who can continue to explore new topics and expand their knowledge through more museum visits.
### **Geylang Serai Heritage Gallery**
During the recent learning journey to the Geylang Serai Heritage Gallery, the Primary 4 students had the opportunity to play the role of explorers. They went on a mission to discover the history of Geylang Serai and its importance to the Malay and Muslim communities in Singapore. The students explored the gallery and visited four different stations, each with friendly educators who told stories and showed interesting objects to make history come alive.
