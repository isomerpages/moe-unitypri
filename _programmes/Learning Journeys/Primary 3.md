### **Kok Fah Technology Farm**
The third week of Term 4 saw learning come alive for our Primary 3 students. They visited Kok Fah farm, an aggrotech farm situated at Kranji. Through hands-on activities and the patient guidance of experienced farm guides, they witnessed the farming technique of hydroponics in growing leafy vegetables.

Students saw how hydroponics could help land scarce countries like Singapore be self-sufficient in food and  gained first-hand experiences what they would normally see in pictures and photographs from their P3 Social Studies Reader. Students marvelled at how the muddy vegetable plots at the mercy of the sun and rain in our grandfathers’ time were now replaced by an elaborate system that ensured efficient nutrient circulation and climate control. All without using pesticides or harmful chemicals! Now, even cool climate crops such as lemon balm, mint or rosemary could be grown in the hydroponics greenhouse and how the well-designed hydroponics system provided an optimal supply of food, water and air!

Our students’ thirst for knowledge was rewarded with a gift guaranteed to quench their thirst – an aloe vera gel drink, most welcome after a day of fun-filled learning!

### **Singapore Zoological Gardens**
The Singapore Zoological Gardens is a secure and organized environment for Science lessons about animals’ characteristics beyond the classroom. The Primary 3 students had the opportunity to enjoy a rewarding morning there on xxxx, observing animals from various groups and learning about their requirements and habitats. One of the key educational objectives was for them to understand the importance of environmental conservation, especially in the light of humanity's impact on animals' natural habitats.
Riding on the tram with audio commentary, the students glimpsed many different animals and got a better overview of the zoo . They also honed their navigation skills by using a map to follow a designated trail. The highlight of the excursion was undoubtedly the Sealion Show at the Amphitheatre, where the students had a splashing whirl of fun.
Overall, it was an exhilarating and educational experience for all!

### **NEWater Visitor Centre**
Learning journey is beneficial to student development as it provides an opportunity for the students to gain real-world experiences that complement classroom learning. The cohort of Primary 3 students had a memorable learning journey to Singapore's NEWater plant. It has given them the opportunity to appreciate Singapore's water sources, understand the effects of climate change and the sustainability efforts Singapore has put in.

The learning journey has not only provided valuable insights into water conservation and efforts of sustainability but also allowed the students to witness firsthand the innovative efforts that Singapore has undertaken to secure its water supply. 

The students were guided through interactive exhibits and engaging presentations, which helped them grasp the concept of wastewater treatment and the transformation of used water into NEWater, Singapore's brand of high-grade reclaimed water. 

The students has learned how Singapore builds a robust, diversified and sustainable water supply from four water sources known as the Four National Taps – Water from Local Catchment , Imported Water, high-grade reclaimed water known as NEWater and Desalinated Water.

It is without a doubt that the P3 students have been enriched in their understanding of the importance of NEWater as part of Singapore’s water supply and how they can contribute to the efforts of saving water.
