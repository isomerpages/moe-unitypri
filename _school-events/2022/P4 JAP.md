# P4 JAP - Our Community

#### May 31

The Junior Achievement (JA) Programme serves to provide opportunities and inspire our students to learn a range of age-appropriate soft skills experientially to contribute to the vitality of their community. 

Through the two-day programme, the Primary 4 students have learnt to recognize how people contribute to and benefit from a community such as understanding what taxes are and how taxation supports government services. Students also gain exposure to the different career choices and types of skills each of these jobs requires. They even have had the opportunity to apply innovation to a production process â€“ coming up with an exclusive donut for sale! In all, the students and teachers have found JAP an engaging and fruitful learning experience.
