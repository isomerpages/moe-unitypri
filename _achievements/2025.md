<h3>River Valley High School Vivid Voices Public Speaking Invitational</h3>
<p>Our school proudly participated in the inaugural River Valley High School
Vivid Voices Public Speaking Invitational 2025. Organised by River Valley
High School through its oracy talent programme, Vivid Voices, this one-day
competition promotes the creative, persuasive and accurate use of the English
language. It also provides an excellent platform for students to build
confidence and grow as effective speakers. Excited by the opportunity to
be part of a community of passionate young orators, our school enthusiastically
nominated students to take part in this enriching experience.</p>
<p>We are delighted to announce that Saanvi Salla from 5E emerged as the
Second Runner-Up!</p>
<p>Heartiest congratulations to Saanvi for her outstanding achievement and
for doing the school proud!</p>
