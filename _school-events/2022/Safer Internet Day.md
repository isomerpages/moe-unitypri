On 14 February 2022, Unity Primary School (UPS) commemorated Safer Internet Day (SID) to raise awareness of the importance of Cyber Wellness (CW) among students and staff and how everyone can be advocates for good netiquette and proper online behaviours. 

SID is a landmark event in the online safety calendar and celebrated in approximately 200 countries worldwide. In line with the key messages of “Be Safe, Be Smart and Be Kind” online, SID is into its 19th year of celebration on 8 February with the global theme: ‘Together for a better Internet’. As part of our Cyber Wellness Awareness Initiative (CWAI), UPS launched the school’s official CW Mascot. Together with the 2022 Cyber Wellness Student Ambassadors (CWSA), CW Mascot will champion the efforts in Good Netiquette and Proper Online Behaviour. A surprise meet-and-greet session was held during recess where students got a chance to meet the new mascot for photo-taking. 

Students also participated in the Mascot Naming Competition. Look out for the name of CW Mascot in Term 2!
