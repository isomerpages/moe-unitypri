Character and Citizenship Education
===================================
![](/images/cce.jpg)

### **Vision**
----------

Students from Unity Primary will grow up to be responsible and respectful citizens with integrity

### **Mission**
-----------

Provide an environment where good values are instilled and cultivated

### Programme Highlights/Enrichment Activities
------------------------------------------

##### **Character Development**

**1) Student Leadership**

In Unity, we believe that every child can be a leader. With this firm belief, all students are given opportunities to learn leadership skills and platforms to exemplify these skills.

To ensure we achieve our student outcome of developing Effective Communicators, Student Leadership training incorporates effective communication skills so that students see the importance of being able to articulate and communicate effectively to become competent leaders. Progressive development in the leadership training also ensures student leaders are equipped with the appropriate skills in order to carry out their duties.

**2) Caught in Action! (CIA)**

In Unity where students exemplify the school values, students are rewarded when they are “caught” doing good deeds. FOS ambassadors and teachers are always on the lookout for acts of graciousness and appreciation.

Classes and individuals embodying the school values are presented with tokens of appreciation and their stories of good deeds shared with the school.

**3) Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP) and i-Character**

The main objectives of FTGP are to provide for quality interaction time between Form Teachers and Co-Form Teachers and students, and to equip students with social and emotional (SE) competencies.

Conducting once a week, FTGP lessons allows purposeful student-teacher interactions and the explicit teaching of SE competencies. Studentswill experience positive school experiences that support their holistic development and better prepare them for life.

Form teachers and Co-Form Teachers also use FTGP period to conduct structured reflections in the i-Character booklet where students are given time to do self-assessments and values reflections. Parents are also involved in the endorsement of these reflections, as parents play an integral role in the holistic development of a child.

**4) Friendship and Kindness Week**

In Unity where everyone matters, the whole school (teachers, students, and non-teaching staff) are involved in this movement to spread positivity during Kindness Week. In line with our vision of Creative Minds, Caring Hearts, we go beyond ourselves, and think of creative ways to show that we care for people around us. It is about going beyond and spreading positivity, making someone’s day.

The FOS ambassadors will be planning assembly talks, pledging of kindness, video montages, murals and many more to really achieve the objectives of the project; to celebrate, inspire and create awareness of kindness.

##### **Citizenship**

**1) National Education and Social Studies**

National Education in Unity, is part of our holistic education, firmly built on our school core values of Integrity, Courage, Respect and Responsibility. It aims to develop national cohesion, cultivate the instinct for survival as a nation and instil in our students, confidence in our nation’s future. It also emphasises on cultivating a sense of belonging and emotional rootedness to Singapore.

Celebrations for NE events in our school focus on engaging our students through their Head, Heart and Hands. Through the celebrations, students in Unity will know Singapore better, love and take pride in being Singaporean and look for avenues and opportunities to contribute and do their part for Singapore.

**2) Values in Action (VIA)**

With our focus on Values-Driven Education, what better way to exemplify our values than doing our part as Singaporeans, for our community and for our country. Our Values-In-Action Programme hence has a focus on conserving our environment and emphasises the importance of keeping our environment clean. We hope to instil in our students a sense of civic-mindedness as well as build awareness among them, to spread the Green message to the community. Various activities are planned for the different levels for students to do their part for the community.

In the spirit of volunteerism, activities such as Happy Toilet, Weekly Recycling Drive and Litter Picking@Pang Sua Canal are planned for students who want to do their part for the environment and community beyond the level planned VIA programmes.

**Moe Sexuality Education in Schools**

1. Sexuality Education (SEd) in schools is about enabling students to understand the physiological, social and emotional changes they experience as they mature, develop healthy and rewarding relationships including those with members of the opposite sex, and make wise, informed and responsible decisions on sexuality matters. SEd is premised on the importance of the family as the basic unit of society. This means encouraging healthy, heterosexual marriages and stable nuclear family units with extended family support. The teaching and learning of SEd is based on respect for the values and beliefs of the different ethnic and religious communities in Singapore on sexuality issues.
2.  The goals of Sexuality Education are:

*   To help students make wise, responsible and informed decisions through the provision of accurate, current and age-appropriate knowledge on human sexuality and the consequences of sexual activity;
*   To help students know themselves and build healthy and rewarding relationships through the acquisition of social and emotional skills of self-awareness, management of their thoughts, feelings and behaviours, development of empathy for others, possession of effective communication, problem-solving and decision-making skills; and
*   To help students develop a moral compass, respect for themselves and for others as sexual beings, premised on the family as the basic unit of society, through the inculcation of positive mainstream values and attitudes about sexuality.

3.  The key messages of Sexuality Education are:

*   Love and respect yourself as you love and respect others;
*   Build positive relationships based on love and respect (which are the foundation for strong families);
*   Make responsible decisions for yourself, your family and society; and
*   Abstinence before marriage is the best protection against STIs/HIV and unintended pregnancies. Casual sex can harm and hurt you and your loved ones.

**Growing Years (GY) Programme**: “Curious Minds (2nd Edition)” (Primary 5 & 6) Teaching & Learning resource package

1.  The upper primary years mark the onset of puberty. With better nutrition and improved health care, children are reaching puberty at a younger age and have to grapple with physical, emotional and psychological changes in themselves. The implication is that our children are becoming biologically ready for sexual activity sooner without necessarily having the corresponding cognitive or emotional maturity to modulate their behaviours. “Curious Minds” is a response to these challenges.
2.  The Primary 5 & 6 Growing Years (GY) package, “Curious Minds (2nd Edition)”, aims to meet students’ developmental needs, give emphasis to the teaching of skills and values, and focus on helping students navigate _changes_, build healthy _relationships_, especially online relationships, and exercise _safety_.

**At Unity Primary School, the following lessons from the Growing Years Programme will be taught in 2019:**
