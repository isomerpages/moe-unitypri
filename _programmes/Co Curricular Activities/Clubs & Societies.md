<p>The English Language, Drama and Debating Club aims to develop our students
into confident speakers. They learn to express their thoughts and opinions
confidently towards topics like current affairs, education and even policies.
They are taught oratorical skills and debating with their peers. In Drama
sessions, they will learn theatrical skills that would enable them to be
better performers on stage. Apart from vocal exercises and tongue twisters,
students get to play games that aim to improve their reflex and teamwork
during drama sessions as well. Students would also be trained to showcase
a short play.</p>

<p>The Mathematics Club aims to provide opportunities for students to develop
their Maths cognition skills.&nbsp; Math&nbsp;is about pattern-recognition,
logic and the ability to play with variables in one’s head. &nbsp;Researchers
have said that through solving puzzles and Maths problems, these will improve
the cognitive and mathematical abilities of children and also assists them
with daily problem-solving capabilities. &nbsp;During the training sessions,
students get to learn all this through play activities. &nbsp;They will
develop their self-confidence, patience and level of&nbsp;concentration.
&nbsp;Through perseverance, students will quickly realise that success
only come after many attempts.&nbsp;</p>
