UPS Art Curriculum provides the foundation for all students to understand art as a way of learning about themselves and the world around them. Involvement in the arts is associated with gains in math, reading, cognitive ability, critical thinking and verbal skills. It can also improve motivation, concentration, confidence and teamwork.

Art is integral to the holistic development of every student, with much emphasis in the aesthetic, cognitive and affective dimensions. Our Art Curriculum is carefully designed to allow students to enjoy art, communicate visually and make meaning through connecting with society and culture.
 
Students are presented with ample opportunities for creative and innovative self-expression in varied modes and in accordance to their interests and talents. The learning of local artworks and artists strengthens the understanding of the individual’s national identity by fostering the appreciation of one’s cultural heritage. 

The engagement in art discussions promotes a lifelong enjoyment and an appreciation for artistic works; develop visual literacy in our students. The production of artwork encourages imagination and cultivates in students the capacity to innovate and improvise.

##### **Year-End Art Exhibition**
The Year-End Art Exhibition is put up every year in conjunction with the Annual Awards Day to celebrate Art. This year, the artwork that inspired the art exhibition was called the The NET. The NET is part of the MOE syllabus and is taught in our newly revamped school curriculum. 

The Art Teachers educated the students about the artist and the reasons why the artwork was created. The exhibition emulates the actual art piece as a Hanging Sculpture & the teachers took the opportunity to showcase this meaningful artwork. With the showcase, students gave us an insight into their desires by expressing what they would want to ‘catch’ if they were given a net.
