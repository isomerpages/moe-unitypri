<h3><strong>West Zone Junior Science Whizz Challenge: Inter-Primary School Science Quiz</strong></h3>
<p>RV STEM Fest is the successor to the Junior Science Whiz Challenge (JSWC)
and River Valley Mathematics Challenge (RVMC). Through a competition segment
and other non-competitive learning activities, RV STEM Fest aims to instil
interest in and promote appreciation of STEM amongst Primary 6 students,
as well as to provide a common platform for students to work together collaboratively
and challenge their thinking and understanding of Mathematics and Sciences.</p>
<p>The theme of the festival this year is “Discoveries and Inventions” which
serves as the core of development and the driving force, shaping the world
we live in. The learning of STEM is an integral part of our education system
and serves as the foundation of innovation and advancement to propel us
towards a better future.</p>
<p>We applaud our students who have brought their enthusiasm to the STEM
Fest and had the opportunity to explore the stories behind remarkable inventions
and groundbreaking discoveries that have moulded today’s society. We believe
the experience has ignited their imagination and inspire dreams of their
own inventions and discoveries. Last but not least, we're thrilled to share
that Aung Minn Thant from 6G has clinched the 9th position in the STEM
Whizz Challenge. Well done!</p>

<h3><strong>Sustainability Advocacy Challenge (SAC) Silver Award</strong></h3>
<p>The Sustainability Advocacy Challenge (SAC), with its "By Youths, For
All" approach, empowers students to lead sustainability initiatives, fostering
creativity, contribution, and collaboration. SAC nurtures youth as eco-stewards,
inspiring them to take action in promoting sustainable living and practising
green citizenship, contributing to a greener Singapore.</p>
<p>Five students from the Greenovation Club represented the school in this
competition and won the Silver Award. Their outreach plan included a series
of impactful activities to spread the message of sustainability. They started
by creating and uploading a step-by-step upcycling video to the Greenie
Website, guiding their schoolmates on how to craft simple upcycled products.
Following that, they set up a live demonstration booth at the annual Science
and Green Carnival, where participants could create and play the upcycled
Claw-it-Up game, as well as learn proper recycling techniques. To increase
engagement, participants could choose between a traditional sorting game
or a timed challenge.</p>
<p>Additionally, to reach out to the community and instil the values of environmental
sustainability from an early age, the Greenovation Club members visited
partnering kindergartens, shared upcycling tips with the young children
and challenged them to play Claw-it-Up.</p>

<h3><strong>Project E.C.O (Educate. Challenge. Organise) GOLD Award</strong></h3>
<p>The team embarked on a 6-month-long project, dedicating their efforts
to heighten dengue prevention awareness in both the school and the community,
with the aim of reducing dengue cases in the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>Executing a two-tier strategy, the team first created a dengue prevention
video from scratch, involving their school mascot. The video was shared
during the school-wide assembly session, where the team reiterated the
importance of collective efforts in dengue prevention. They also set up
various environmental booths during the annual Science &amp; Green Carnival
to engage their peers in dengue prevention and environmental conservation
through games, quizzes, and flyers.</p>
<p>To extend their reach to the community, the team designed post cards and
distributed them to residents during the annual Estate Collection Day.
Partnering PCF kindergarten, door-to-door visits were also conducted to
educate residents on B-L-O-C-K steps. The project had heightened awareness
in residents to take dengue preventive measures.</p>
