<p>Unity Primary School was established in 1999 and it is with great honour
and pride that we commemorated our school’s 25th anniversary in 2024. The
dedication, commitment and conviction of our staff, with the ardent and
unwavering support of our parents, our School Advisory Committee and various
partners, has enabled us to accomplish many successes in realising quality
and holistic education to bring about the desired outcomes for our students.</p>
<p>As we inspire and educate our young charges, we cannot do it alone. Parents
play an equally critical role in our children’s education. It is imperative
that the school and families work collaboratively to yield the best educational
outcomes. The primary school years solidify the foundation for learning
and parents support in ensuring their child comes to school prepared to
learn is essential for their continual development.</p>
<p>We seek to deliver a holistic education that makes learning meaningful,
builds character and ensures that every child is equipped with the skills
and competencies to navigate the future. We are committed to providing
quality teaching and learning in and out of the classrooms and value-adding
to the lives of our students. As stated in MOE Singapore Curriculum Philosophy,
we believe that learning flourishes in caring and safe learning environment;
when children construct knowledge actively; through the development of
thinking skills and dispositions; and when assessment is used to address
learning gaps.</p>
<p>As stewards of lives, we take pride in our work and consider it a privilege
to be able to nurture and mould the future of Singapore. Our students will
always be at the core of our mission and they can look forward to many
opportunities for development such as learning to get along with friends
from different background, learning about our fragile natural environment,
and more importantly, learning more about themselves and what they are
good at! We envisage developing every student to have a ‘Creative Mind’,
become a ‘Confident Self’ and have a ‘Caring Heart’, leaving an indelible
mark wherever they go!</p>
<p>With your continued support and partnership, we forge ahead with faith
as always in touching lives and transforming futures!</p>
