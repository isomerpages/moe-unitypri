### **<u>Vision</u>**

Students to develop a life-long interest in Science and apply scientific methods and principles to other disciplines.

### **<u>Mission</u>**

To make the learning of Science exciting, meaningful and relevant.

To nurture and encourage questioning.

### **<u>Programme Highlights</u>**
#### **Inquiry-based Learning**

In Unity Primary, Science lessons are conducted using the Inquiry-based approach to harness the power of questioning and reasoning. Our students are shown how the products of scientific investigations were derived by scientists and be provided opportunities to: ask questions about knowledge and issues that relate to their daily lives, society and the environment; be actively engaged in the collection and use of evidence; formulate and communicate explanations based on scientific knowledge.

Through inquiry learning, our students will be able to acquire knowledge and understanding of their natural and physical world based on investigations, apply the skills and processes of inquiry and develop attitudes and values that are essential to the practice of science.

#### **Experiential Learning**

Apart from classroom learning, our students also have the opportunity to engage in experiential learning such as through learning journeys and enrichment workshops.  

The school has also digitised our eco-garden to enable our students can find out more the diversity of plants whether rain or shine. Using interactive tools, students can learn about the characteristics of plants and engaged in mini quizzes to consolidate their learning.

The philosophy behind the **Tea**cher **C**ontent, **C**ompetency & **C**apacity en**H**ancement Programme is based on a (triangle-based) pyramid. A pyramid is a very stable structure that can withstand the test of time. As such, the department aims to build up on the 3 cornerstones of Content, Capacity and Competency of our staff. This will then enable our students to reach the peak of Excellence.

Similarly, the department believes that Teachers, Parents and Students form a ‘Triumvirate’ that can work in synergy to reach the peak of Excellence. This is done through the Communication of Learning Outcomes, Sharing of Concepts & Misconceptions & Exemplars of Questions & Answers using our C3 Answering Technique.

#### C3 Answering Technique

C3 Answering Technique is the technique used by our students to answer Explain-type Open-ended Questions. Students are taught to identify the **C**oncept, **C**onnection, **C**onclusion parts of the answer and to structure them into a complete answer.

*   **Concept**
    *   What is/are the concept(s) being tested?
*   **Connection**
    *   What is the context/connection to the question?
*   **Conclusion**
    *   What happens/is the result in the end?


### **<u>Assessment</u>**

The department adopts a variety of assessment modes to assess our students’ learning. Apart from the pen and pencil examinations, students are also assess through formative assessments.

Our table of specification for examination papers is based on a spiral approach where pupils are constantly being tested on concepts they have learnt previously but at a higher level of difficulty. This helps to prepare them for PSLE where they will be tested on concepts from both the Upper and Lower Block. This also helps them to integrate concepts from different themes in order to answer cross thematic and higher-order thinking questions.

### **<u>Project Work</u>**
Project work is a platform that allows students to make links of their knowledge across different subject areas as well as to demonstrate their creativity and innovation to an assigned project task. They get to hone their skills as an effective communicator to present their ideas clearly to the targeted audience in both written and oral forms. Students will acquire collaborative skills as they work in groups to achieve common goals. Through PW, we are a promoting self-directed learning as they do their independent research and reflection.

#### P4 PW
The P4 students will work in groups to upcycle and design Maths games for the P2 students. While promoting and developing the love and interest for Mathematics through games, students will also bring environmental conservation habits from school back to home.

#### P6 PW
The P6 Students would work in groups and use their creativity to innovate a product to solve issue(s) faced by the elderly & market it to their targeted consumers.
