The P1 Sports and Games enrichment Programme seeks to further develop students’ psychomotor, cognitive and affective domains. Students will be exposed to games and activities that are extended from the PE curriculum’s FUNdamental Skills to enhance their skills-learning experience and enjoyment. Through these activities, the school aims to provide fun and inclusive experiences for the students and at the same time develop positive Teacher-Student-Relationship (TSR).

**P3 Swimming Programme (SwimSafer 2.0)**

Swimming lessons are conducted for all P3 classes and carried out over 8 weeks at allocated swimming pools. The SwimSafer™ 2.0 program aims to teach swimming proficiency and water survival skills in a fun manner to children to minimize drowning incidences.  The six-stage programme includes survival and activity skills taught each stage of the programme, which work progressively towards the next stage. At the end of each stage, each child will receive a stage completion e-certificate.

_As the P3 cohort last year (2020) missed out the programme due to Covid, they will go through the programme this year (2021)._

**P5 Outdoor Adventure Camp**

The P5 Outdoor Adventure Camp\* has been conducted annually since 2009 as part of the PE programme. The objective of this 3-day 2-night camp is to inculcate resilience, leadership and independence through the outdoors. The activities conducted by experienced instructors and co-facilitated by teachers are designed to build self-esteem and foster esprit de corps among the students.

_\*Due to the current COVID-situation, there will be no overnight school cohort camps. Students can look forward to a P5 Adventure Day Camp where safe management measures (SMM) will be adhered to strictly and changes to the camp programme will be made to ensure that students do not miss out this valuable school learning experience._
