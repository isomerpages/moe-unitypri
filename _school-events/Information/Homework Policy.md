Homework Policy
===============

**Homework Guideline**
----------------------

**Rationale**

Homework is typically defined as any tasks “assigned to students by school teachers that are meant to be carried out during non-school hours[\[1\]](https://unitypri.moe.edu.sg/parents-matter/information/homework-policy/#_ftn1)”.This, however, does not include time spent on revision of school work or studying for tests and examinations.

Homework plays an important role in the holistic development of a child. For a new skill or knowledge to have long-lasting effects, distributed and sustained practice is necessary. Furthermore, homework assignments have a positive impact on the personal development of the students. It helps to develop good study habits and foster independent learning. It also has the prospects to foster partnership between parents and school in the child’s learning, hence reaffirming the important role of parents in education.

**Guiding Principles**

As a general rule of thumb, the types and purposes of homework designed and disseminated are as follows:

<style type="text/css">
.tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;}
.tg td{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;
  overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;}
.tg th{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;
  font-weight:normal;overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;}
.tg .tg-h5mn{background-color:#E6E6E6;color:#222;text-align:left;vertical-align:middle}
.tg .tg-8d3w{background-color:#FFF;border-color:inherit;color:#222;font-weight:bold;text-align:center;vertical-align:top}
.tg .tg-4ufn{background-color:#FFF;color:#222;font-weight:bold;text-align:center;vertical-align:top}
