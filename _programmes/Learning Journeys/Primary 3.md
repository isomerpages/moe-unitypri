<h3><strong>Kok Fah Technology Farm</strong></h3>
<p>Our Primary 3 students visit Kok Fah Technology Farm, an agri-tech farm
located in Kranji. Here, they experience firsthand how technology is shaping
modern farming through hydroponics—the method of growing vegetables without
soil.</p>
<p>Guided by experienced farm staff, students observe how hydroponic systems
use 70% less water than traditional soil-based farming. They learn how
this sustainable method helps land-scarce countries like Singapore grow
food efficiently and responsibly.</p>
<p>A major highlight is the chance to taste fresh produce such as lettuce,
basil, and mint. The hands-on experience is complemented by a learning
session that connects the farm’s practices to their Social Studies curriculum,
showing how farming in Singapore has evolved over time.</p>
<p>This journey opens students’ eyes to food sustainability, innovation in
agriculture, and how we can all play a role in supporting a greener future.</p>

<h3><strong>Singapore Zoological Gardens</strong></h3>
<p>The visit to the Singapore Zoo offers students an engaging, real-world
extension of their Science lessons on animals and their habitats. In this
safe and immersive environment, students observe animals up close while
learning about their characteristics, diets, and the ecosystems they live
in.</p>
<p>They practise using a map to navigate a designated trail, enhancing their
spatial awareness and planning skills. A tram ride with audio commentary
gives students a broader perspective of the zoo and its layout, while the
Sealion Show at the Amphitheatre brings smiles and laughter to all.</p>
<p>Throughout the experience, students are also introduced to the importance
of wildlife conservation, helping them reflect on humanity’s role in protecting
the environment and its creatures.</p>

<h3><strong>NEWater Visitor Centre</strong></h3>
<p>At the NEWater Visitor Centre, students explore one of Singapore’s most
important sustainability efforts: our water supply. This learning journey
supports the Science curriculum while helping students appreciate the importance
of resource conservation and innovation.</p>
<p>Through interactive exhibits and engaging presentations, students learn
how Singapore produces high-grade reclaimed water from used water, known
as NEWater. They are introduced to the Four National Taps— local catchment
water, imported water, desalinated water, and NEWater—and how each plays
a role in ensuring a stable and sustainable water supply.</p>
<p>The visit leaves a lasting impression on students, showing them how science,
technology, and community responsibility come together to secure Singapore’s
water future. More importantly, it empowers them to take simple steps in
their daily lives to conserve this precious resource.</p>
