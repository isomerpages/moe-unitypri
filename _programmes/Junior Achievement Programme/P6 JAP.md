### **Hour of Code**
Learning did not stop after PSLE. The Primary 6 students had the chance to experience and use basic coding and computer science to create games, built a galaxy, worked with puzzles and many more. They also got to apply coding to attempt to remove trash from the ocean in the lesson ‘AI for Oceans’. It was an enriching experience for the students!
