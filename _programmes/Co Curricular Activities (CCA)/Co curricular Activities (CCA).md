Co-curricular Activities
========================
![](/images/UPS-Website-Banners-3.png)

One of the Co-Curriculum Programme provided by the school is the Co-curricular Activities (CCA). The school’s CCA focuses on development of specific knowledge, skills & values based on the student’s choice of CCA. The CCA enables students to discover their interests & talents while providing a platform for friendships & social integration of students from diverse backgrounds.  Well-organised & implemented, they fuel in the student a life-long love for a particular activity, be it a sport or a musical pursuit. This helps the student to lead a balanced life in adulthood.
