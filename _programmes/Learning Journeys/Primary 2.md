### **Hay Dairies Goat Farm**
On 16 May 2025, the Primary 2 students embarked on a learning journey to Hay Dairies Goat Farm, nestled in the peaceful surroundings of Neo Tiew Crescent. The visit offered students a valuable opportunity to explore farm life and gain insights into goat farming in Singapore.<br>
The experience began with a guided introduction to the farm's background and operations. Students learned about the different breeds of goats raised on the farm and observed the milking process firsthand. They also learned how to distinguish between cow milk and goat milk while discovering the nutritional benefits of goat milk.<br>
The goat feeding session was the highlight of the visit. As they walked along the viewing trail, the students eagerly fed the goats alfalfa hay. Some enthusiastic children even displayed great courage by gently petting the goats and feeding them from their hands — a delightful and memorable experience. <br>
The visit ended on a sweet note, with each student receiving a souvenir and a bottle of delicious chocolate goat milk. This learning journey has inspired students to empathise with animals and develop deeper appreciation for them. It was truly a joyful day of discovery.

### **Theatre Experience**
As part of the school’s Learn for Life Programme to inculcate character and values through experiential and authentic learning, the Primary 2 students embarked on a learning journey to Gateway Theatre to watch a performance entitled ‘The Invisible Pangolin’ on 25 July 2024.  The theatre experience provides the opportunity for the students to practise correct theatre etiquette and value of respect during a performance.<br>
‘The Invisible Pangolin’ is about three friends, a Monkey, Owl and Tiger who come across a mysterious ball that turns out to be a classmate (Pangolin) whom they have never “seen” before. “The Invisible Pangolin” is an interactive theatre experience that delves into the themes of friendship, embracing differences, being noticed, the importance of saying “no” and the value of giving space. <br>
The performance was enchanting, captivating the young audience from the very first moment. The vibrant costumes and colourful set design created a whimsical world that instantly drew the children in. The actors, with their animated expressions and lively movements, brought the characters to life in a way that was both magical and relatable. The dialogue and interactions resonated with the young audience, eliciting laughter and gasps of amazement. <br>
As the show came to an end, the theater erupted with applause. The learning journey was truly an unforgettable experience. When the students returned to school, they reflected happily on their favourite parts and characters of the performance.

### **River Wonders**
After missing out on the opportunity to visit River Wonders due to COVID in 2021, the P2 students and teachers were elated to be able to embark on their LJ at the end of Term 2 this year when the SMMs were eased. All of them had a fascinating time seeing the actual animals which they saw on the virtual LJ last year. The sight of manatees and giant stingrays at the Amazon Flooded Forest enthralled the students. Many saw electric eel and piranha for the first time. The highlight of the visit was getting to see Jia Jia and Le Le at the panda enclosure. It was a sight to behold, with Le Le perched on the tree branch, enjoying his nap! Importantly, the classes had a wonderful time bonding with one another on their 1st ever LJ since they joined Unity Primary School at P1.

### **Supermarket**
As part of the Life Skills Development Programme to promote financial literacy, the P2 students embarked on a E-learning Journey to the supermarket to learn how to manage the limited budget that they had in preparation for an event.
They participated in the planning for a class party by learning how to purchase items online from the supermarket websites.<br>
Before the planning, the students were introduced to the following concepts:
* Estimation
* Budgeting
* Reading of the nutrition labels of items
* Importance of sourcing for healthier choices
* Difference between needs and wants
* Importance of saving

To further apply these concepts into daily lives, the students planned their own purchase of snacks for a week when they visited the supermarket with their parents or family members. It was definitely an enriching and interactive experience for the P2 students.
