### **Home-Based Learning (HBL)**
Home-Based Learning (HBL) exercises will be conducted in every academic year.  For each HBL exercise, students will be assigned with both online and offline assignments.

School will keep parents informed of the HBL schedule for each exercise via Parents Gateway (PG). This will allow parents to play a complementary role by helping to monitor the progress of their children’s learning in terms of work completion.  

As for the students, the HBL schedule will be shared with them via Student Learning Space (SLS) to encourage them to exercise responsibility for their own learning and to be self-directed learners.

HBL dates for 2023 are as shown in the table below:

*The national exams dates may be subjected to changes and parents will be informed of any changes in a timely manner.*
