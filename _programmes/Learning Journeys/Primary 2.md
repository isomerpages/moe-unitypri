<h3><strong>Hay Dairies Goat Farm</strong></h3>
<p>Our Primary 2 students get a taste of rural life during their visit to
Hay Dairies Goat Farm in Neo Tiew Crescent. This learning journey introduces
them to Singapore’s local agriculture and offers a close-up view of farm
operations.</p>
<p>Students learn about goat breeds, the milking process, and how goat milk
compares to cow milk in terms of nutrition. The highlight of the trip is
the interactive goat feeding session, where students get to offer alfalfa
hay and even pet the goats gently—an exciting and memorable experience
for many.</p>
<p>The visit ends with a treat: each child brings home a bottle of chocolate
goat milk and a souvenir. More than just a fun day out, this journey encourages
empathy towards animals and nurtures a deeper appreciation for nature and
farming.</p>

<h3><strong>Theatre Experience</strong></h3>
<p>As part of the school’s Learn for Life Programme to inculcate character
and values through experiential and authentic learning, the Primary 2 students
embarked on a learning journey to Gateway Theatre to watch a performance
entitled ‘The Invisible Pangolin’ on 25 July 2024. The theatre experience
provides the opportunity for the students to practise correct theatre etiquette
and value of respect during a performance.
<br>‘The Invisible Pangolin’ is about three friends, a Monkey, Owl and Tiger
who come across a mysterious ball that turns out to be a classmate (Pangolin)
whom they have never “seen” before. “The Invisible Pangolin” is an interactive
theatre experience that delves into the themes of friendship, embracing
differences, being noticed, the importance of saying “no” and the value
of giving space.
<br>The performance was enchanting, captivating the young audience from the
very first moment. The vibrant costumes and colourful set design created
a whimsical world that instantly drew the children in. The actors, with
their animated expressions and lively movements, brought the characters
to life in a way that was both magical and relatable. The dialogue and
interactions resonated with the young audience, eliciting laughter and
gasps of amazement.
<br>As the show came to an end, the theater erupted with applause. The learning
journey was truly an unforgettable experience. When the students returned
to school, they reflected happily on their favourite parts and characters
of the performance.</p>

<h3><strong>River Wonders</strong></h3>
<p>At the end of Term 2, students visit River Wonders, an exciting continuation
of their wildlife education journey.</p>
<p>From the Amazon Flooded Forest to the Giant Panda Forest, students are
enthralled by creatures like manatees, stingrays, electric eels, and piranhas.
A major highlight is spotting Le Le napping on a tree branch alongside
his mother, Jia Jia—a moment students won’t soon forget.</p>
<p>Beyond the animal encounters, this trip allows classmates to bond as they
explore and learn together outside the classroom.</p>

<h3><strong>Supermarket</strong></h3>
<p>To promote financial literacy and healthy decision-making, students participate
in an E-learning Journey to the supermarket as part of our Life Skills
Development Programme.</p>
<p>In preparation for a class party, students learn how to:</p>
<p>• Estimate costs</p>
<p>• Work within a budget</p>
<p>• Read nutrition labels</p>
<p>• Make healthier food choices</p>
<p>• Differentiate between needs and wants</p>
<p>• Understand the importance of saving</p>
<p>They also apply these skills at home by planning their own snack purchases
during a visit to the supermarket with their families. This experience
builds practical life skills in a fun and meaningful way that bridges learning
from school to home.</p>
