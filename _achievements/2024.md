<h3><strong>National Public Speaking Competition</strong></h3>
<p>The National Public Speaking Competition is a public speaking contest
for students in the Primary and Secondary categories. Contestants get to
experience the challenge of competing against the best speakers at the
national level. The NPSC is currently into its 11th year of running and
offers young communicators the big stage as one of the largest public speaking
competitions.</p>
<p>Last year, Afruz Salih from 5G did our school proud when he emerged a
finalist in the10th place at the Grand Finals held at the Young Men Christianâ€™s
Association headquarters. This year, 5 contestants from our school made
it to the top 12th places out of a total of 20 finalists. It was indeed
commendable efforts. Heartiest congratulations and kudos to the following
students for doing the school proud.</p>

<h3><strong>Project E.C.O (Educate. Challenge. Organise) GOLD Award</strong></h3>
<p>The team embarked on a 6-month-long project, dedicating their efforts
to heighten dengue prevention awareness in both the school and the community,
with the aim of reducing dengue cases in the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>Executing a two-tier strategy, the team first created a dengue prevention
video from scratch, involving their school mascot. The video was shared
during the school-wide assembly session, where the team reiterated the
importance of collective efforts in dengue prevention. They also set up
various environmental booths during the annual Science &amp; Green Carnival
to engage their peers in dengue prevention and environmental conservation
through games, quizzes, and flyers.</p>
<p>To extend their reach to the community, the team designed post cards and
distributed them to residents during the annual Estate Collection Day.
Partnering PCF kindergarten, door-to-door visits were also conducted to
educate residents on B-L-O-C-K steps. The project had heightened awareness
in residents to take dengue preventive measures.</p>
