<h3><strong>Hay Dairies Goat Farm</strong></h3>
<p>Our Primary 2 students get a taste of rural life during their visit to
Hay Dairies Goat Farm in Neo Tiew Crescent. This learning journey introduces
them to Singapore’s local agriculture and offers a close-up view of farm
operations.</p>
<p>Students learn about goat breeds, the milking process, and how goat milk
compares to cow milk in terms of nutrition. The highlight of the trip is
the interactive goat feeding session, where students get to offer alfalfa
hay and even pet the goats gently—an exciting and memorable experience
for many.</p>
<p>The visit ends with a treat: each child brings home a bottle of chocolate
goat milk and a souvenir. More than just a fun day out, this journey encourages
empathy towards animals and nurtures a deeper appreciation for nature and
farming.</p>

<h3><strong>Theatre Experience</strong></h3>
<p>As part of the school’s Learn for Life Programme, our students attend
a live theatre performance. This experience not only introduces them to
the performing arts but also provides a valuable opportunity to practise
theatre etiquette and the value of respect in shared spaces.</p>
<p>One such performance that the students have attended, The Invisible Pangolin,
explores important themes such as friendship, inclusion, boundaries, and
self-expression. Through vibrant costumes, engaging storytelling, and relatable
characters, students are captivated while learning meaningful life lessons.</p>
<p>After the performance, students return to school excited to reflect on
their favourite moments and characters, which is a testament to the impact
of learning through the arts.</p>

<h3><strong>River Wonders</strong></h3>
<p>At the end of Term 2, students visit River Wonders, an exciting continuation
of their wildlife education journey.</p>
<p>From the Amazon Flooded Forest to the Giant Panda Forest, students are
enthralled by creatures like manatees, stingrays, electric eels, and piranhas.
A major highlight is spotting Le Le napping on a tree branch alongside
his mother, Jia Jia—a moment students won’t soon forget.</p>
<p>Beyond the animal encounters, this trip allows classmates to bond as they
explore and learn together outside the classroom.</p>

<h3><strong>Supermarket</strong></h3>
<p>To promote financial literacy and healthy decision-making, students participate
in an E-learning Journey to the supermarket as part of our Life Skills
Development Programme.</p>
<p>In preparation for a class party, students learn how to:</p>
<p>• Estimate costs</p>
<p>• Work within a budget</p>
<p>• Read nutrition labels</p>
<p>• Make healthier food choices</p>
<p>• Differentiate between needs and wants</p>
<p>• Understand the importance of saving</p>
<p>They also apply these skills at home by planning their own snack purchases
during a visit to the supermarket with their families. This experience
builds practical life skills in a fun and meaningful way that bridges learning
from school to home.</p>
