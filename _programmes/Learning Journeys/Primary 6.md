<h3><strong>Race to Sustainability (Gardens by the Bay)</strong></h3>
<p>Race to Sustainability event is a highlight for all Primary 6 students.
Held annually at Gardens by the Bay, this outdoor adventure blends environmental
education with teamwork and digital literacy. Using their devices, students
solve clues and tackle challenges focused on sustainability, Science, and
Math.</p>
<p>In 2024, students explored the gardens while solving real-world problems—such
as calculating the height and area of the iconic Supertrees and learning
about global threats to biodiversity. A specially designed Math and Science
trail further sharpened their observation and reasoning skills.</p>
<p>Adding to the excitement, selected Primary 2 students joined the official
flag-off and took part in a green-themed activity alongside Ms. Grace Fu,
Minister for Sustainability and the Environment. It was an inspiring and
unforgettable experience for all involved—especially as it marked the final
learning journey before graduating from Unity.</p>

<h3><strong>Learning Journey to Singapore Discovery Centre</strong></h3>
<p>At the Singapore Discovery Centre, students explore Singapore’s transformation
from past to present through interactive exhibitions and multi-sensory
learning experiences. They learn about key historical events, examine national
challenges, and reflect on what it takes for a small nation to thrive.</p>
<p>As part of the visit, students tour the SAFTI Military Institute, where
they get a glimpse of the life and training of SAF officers and learn more
about Singapore’s approach to defence and security.</p>
<p>The experience concludes with a screening at the iWERKS Theatre, where
students watch a short film that reinforces the values of resilience, perseverance,
and unity—important themes as they prepare for their own next chapter.</p>

of Singapore’s early cultural connections with the region. Through curated
stations and guided tours, students discover how ancient civilisations
influence Singapore’s heritage today.</p>
<p>They examine artefacts, listen to stories, and engage in thoughtful discussions
led by museum educators. This experience brings their Social Studies learning
to life, helping them make meaningful connections between the past and
present.</p>
<p>By the end of the visit, students develop a stronger appreciation for
the cultural diversity and shared history that shape Singapore’s identity.</p>

<h3><strong>Learning Journey to Sungei Buloh</strong></h3>
<p>As part of the Science curriculum, students embark on a nature hike at
Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve to observe animals and plants in their natural
habitats.</p>
<p>They spot mudskippers, monitor lizards, and migratory birds while exploring
the mangrove ecosystem. Along the way, they discover how plants and animals
adapt to their environment and understand the importance of mangroves in
maintaining ecological balance.</p>
<p>This journey strengthens their learning of topics such as Living Together
and Adaptations, while also nurturing a love for nature and environmental
responsibility.</p>
