P1 students reported to their first day of school on Tuesday, 4 January 2022 while their older schoolmates resumed school the next day. P1 Orientation was specifically structured during the first week of school so that the little ones could adapt to the new environment and school routines. Through various class activities and the school tour, the students had fun bonding with their new teachers and classmates. 

During recess on Tuesday, a parent of each P1 student had the opportunity to observe their children buying food, and doing wipe-down. Both parents and teachers were tremendously proud to see smiley and confident faces on the newbies as they became more accustomed to school over the week. Good job, P1 students!
