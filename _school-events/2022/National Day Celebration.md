# National Day Celebration 2022

#### Aug 8

On 8 August 2022, the School Hall was abuzz with exuberance once again with all students and staff gathered for the celebration of the nation’s 57th birthday. The celebration started with the Observance Ceremony, a solemn and dignified affair which saw our Scouts marching in proudly with the national flag. The sight certainly did well to evoke a strong sense of belonging and pride for this country that we all call Home. 

One of the highlights of the celebration got to be the Games segment, which included our own rendition of the popular game show ‘Don’t Forget the Lyrics’, using some of the students’ favourite National Day songs like ‘Home’ and ‘Tomorrow’s Here Today’. Clarissa (5F), Yu Yuit (5G), Yee Kai (5G) and Mr Amirul did an amazing job hosting the games and enlivening the atmosphere in the Hall. Kudos to them! 

The celebration then culminated in a song-and-dance segment, which saw students from the Choir CCA lending their melodious voices to a rousing finale of community singing and our PE teachers leading everyone in an energizing Unity Fun Dance. Everyone was filled with good cheer and spirits, and it was heartening to see everyone working together to make this celebration a success. Indeed, Stronger Together, Majulah!
