Applied Learning Programme
==========================

EL Fest is part of the school’s Applied Learning Programme (ALP) and it aims to promote the joy of learning and inculcate a greater interest in the learning of the English Language. The students were treated to a repertoire of fun and exciting activities.

Teachers recommended books to the students via Book Buzz and students participated in the Charity Book Drive, Read for Books, organised by NLB.  EL Fest continued in the classrooms through language-centric activities like memory and bingo games for P1 and P2 levels while the P3 to P6 students engaged in boggles and charades. The EL Fest culminated with Storigami which involved teachers telling stories using origami.

The EL Enrichment Programme in UPS aims to expose students to learning beyond the curriculum. Varied learning opportunities across levels are planned for students throughout their years in UPS. All students engage in a range of activities that provide opportunities for them to perform confidently, think critically and communicate effectively in front of adult audiences in addition to their schoolmates.

The **Read A Book Because It’s Terrific! (R.A.B.B.I.T)** programme was introduced in 2014 as part of the school’s Applied Learning Programme (ALP). R.A.B.B.I.T encourages students to read a wide variety of books from different sources and think critically about what they have read.

Students can look forward to the latest book reviews with NLB, a meet-and-greet with a local author, or even the termly mass borrowing. In-house activities provide in-depth knowledge about books as they learn about the novelisation of their favourite movies such as The Cat in the Hat by Dr. Seuss or The Midnight Gang by David Walliams.
