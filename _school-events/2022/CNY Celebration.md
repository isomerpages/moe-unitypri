# Chinese New Year Celebration

#### Jan 31–Feb 9

The school had a joyous time on the eve of Chinese New Year. Before the commencement of the e-concert, the students had a whale of fun doing craft work with the guidance of their form and co-form teachers. Look at the wonderful pieces of Tiger Origami and Traditional Paper Cuttings creatively designed and handmade by P1 to P6 students! 

Students were surprised and excited by the school leaders and lion dance troupe entering their classrooms. They greeted the ‘guests’ with mandarin oranges and auspicious greetings. Throughout the concert, the students and teachers were meaningfully engaged with in-house performances specially put up by our talented teachers and students. One of the highlights was definitely the interactive game segment, Kahoot! Representatives from each class eagerly took up the challenge, participated actively and answered a series of questions with relevance to the concert videos and performances. 

In conclusion, Chinese New Year celebration 2022 was a great success! The concert ended off on a high note, featuring our in-house music video production specially put up by Team UPS. In Unity, We Celebrate!
