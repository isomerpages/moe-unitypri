<h3><strong>Outdoor Education Learning Journey</strong></h3>
<p>Our Primary 4 students kick off the year with an Outdoor Education Learning
Journey to Sensory Garden @ Yew Tee. This refreshing experience in nature
encourages exploration and mindfulness while building lifelong habits of
healthy living and environmental appreciation.</p>
<p>Equipped with their PE Journals, students observe and sketch experience
maps of their surroundings, learning about unique tree species and even
discovering parasitic plants. As part of the learning, students practise
self-care and hygiene, enjoying healthy snacks like fruits and nuts in
a clean and responsible way.</p>
<p>This journey fosters an appreciation for local green spaces while encouraging
personal responsibility and active living—an enriching blend of fun and
learning in the great outdoors.

<h3><strong>Museum Based Learning</strong></h3>
<p>As part of the refreshed art education curriculum, students visit the
National Gallery Singapore to explore how art captures identity, history
and culture.</p>
<p>Through engaging exhibits, students learn about pioneer artists such as
Georgette Chen and Tay Boon Pin, exploring how portraits can reveal emotion,
character, and the artist’s worldview. They also encounter powerful sculptures
like Long House and Life of Miao, gaining insights into the meanings behind
artistic materials and forms.</p>
<p>With artworks like Chua Mia Tee’s "National Language Class" and Lim Hak
Tai’s "Riot", students also see how visual art preserves key moments in
Singapore’s history. This journey shows how art and heritage are closely
intertwined—and how creativity can be a powerful lens for understanding
the world.</p>

<h3><strong>Geylang Serai Heritage Gallery</strong></h3>
<p>In this heritage-based learning journey, students step into the rich cultural
history of the Geylang Serai area. At the Geylang Serai Heritage Gallery,
they learn about the traditions, values, and contributions of the Malay
and Muslim communities in Singapore.</p>
<p>Students explore various stations in the gallery guided by passionate
educators, discovering traditional attire, cultural artefacts, and community
stories. A new addition this year is the precinct walk to the Geylang Serai
Market, where students observe the colourful buzz of food stalls, traditional
clothing shops, and spice vendors—bringing their learning to life in an
authentic and sensory way.</p>
<p>It is a meaningful journey that deepens understanding of cultural heritage
and promotes inter-cultural appreciation.</p>

<h3><strong>Kreta Ayer Heritage Gallery</strong></h3>
<p>Our students explore Kreta Ayer Heritage Gallery to learn about the culture
and contributions of the Chinese community in Singapore. Through interactive
exhibits, they are introduced to five key cultural elements: Chinese Opera,
Chinese Puppetry, Calligraphy, Tea Culture, and Nanyin Music.</p>
<p>The experience continues with a guided Chinatown precinct walk, where
students discover the historical significance of places like Sago Lane,
appreciate traditional shophouse architecture, and learn about how Chinatown
has evolved through the decades.</p>
<p>This journey not only enhances their Social Studies learning but also
fosters a deeper appreciation of Singapore’s multicultural heritage.</p>

<h3><strong>MTL Chinese Cultural Programme Exposure Scheme (CPES)</strong></h3>
<p>As part of the <strong>Chinese Cultural Programme Exposure Scheme (CPES)</strong>,
students experience Chinese Language learning in a lively and immersive
way. For example, students experience performances such as, <strong>《聪明先生》 (<em>Mr. Smart</em>)</strong>,
which brought Chinese idioms and folklore to life through humour and interactive
theatre. The show engaged students with witty dialogue, vibrant acting,
and opportunities to participate—making the learning of Chinese language
both meaningful and enjoyable. Students not only expanded their vocabulary
but also gained a deeper appreciation for Chinese cultural expressions
and storytelling.</p>
<p>This experience reinforces the value of language learning through culture
and the arts, encouraging students to connect more personally with what
they learn in class.</p>
