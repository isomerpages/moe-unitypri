The Junior Achievement Programme (JAP) serves to provide opportunities and inspire our students to learn a range of age-appropriate soft skills experientially to contribute to the vitality of their community.

Through the two-day programme, the Primary 3 students were introduced the concept of earning, spending, saving, and donating. They learnt that money had to be earned before they could spend it. Students also got a chance to plan their personal budget, differentiate between wants and needs, as well as understand that spending is not the only option. They could choose to save and donate. In all, the students learnt to be more money-smart so that they can make more informed decisions to help them achieve their financial goals and dreams!
