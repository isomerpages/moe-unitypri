# Racial Harmony Day 2022

#### Aug 5

As part of National Education, the school commemorated Racial Harmony Day on 18 July 2022. In line with this yearâ€™s school focus on understanding the different festivals celebrated by the different races and the stories behind their celebrations, the students learnt more about Hari Raya Haji, Mid-Autumn Festival and Pongal through an engaging morning assembly programme. During recess, students were also able to try out different traditional games like Five Stones, Chaptek and Gasing and take part in some art and craft activities like using paper strips to make ketupat, henna pattern painting and Chinese paper cutting. It was heartening to see many parents volunteering to help with the recess activities and the students having fun taking part in them. The commemoration of Racial Harmony Day has indeed helped the students to gain a deeper appreciation of racial harmony, multiculturalism and social cohesion.
