<h3><strong>Project E.C.O (Educate. Challenge. Organise) GOLD Award</strong></h3>
<p>The team embarked on a 6-month-long project, dedicating their efforts
to heighten dengue prevention awareness in both the school and the community,
with the aim of reducing dengue cases in the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>Executing a two-tier strategy, the team first created a dengue prevention
video from scratch, involving their school mascot. The video was shared
during the school-wide assembly session, where the team reiterated the
importance of collective efforts in dengue prevention. They also set up
various environmental booths during the annual Science &amp; Green Carnival
to engage their peers in dengue prevention and environmental conservation
through games, quizzes, and flyers.</p>
<p>To extend their reach to the community, the team designed post cards and
distributed them to residents during the annual Estate Collection Day.
Partnering PCF kindergarten, door-to-door visits were also conducted to
educate residents on B-L-O-C-K steps. The project had heightened awareness
in residents to take dengue preventive measures.</p>
