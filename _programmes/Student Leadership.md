<p><strong>Developing Students as Leaders</strong></p><p>As our world becomes increasingly complex and changes at a faster pace, leadership is no longer seen as the domain of few who hold the expertise or authority but is distributed and shared by all members of the group. The need for leaders who can build bridges across cultures and operate in the midst of technological change has also increased in our globalised world.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Programmes/2024/Picture_1.jpeg"></div><p>Many leadership theories have been developed and have diversely defined leadership as a <strong>set of traits, competencies, behaviours or extent of influence</strong> (Dugan &amp; Komives, 2011). Notwithstanding, they share a common belief that <strong>leadership is values-driven, </strong>with good leadership necessarily<strong> grounded in the sound values of the leader.</strong></p><p><strong>Based on Kouzes’ The Leadership Challenge’, </strong>leadership is not about personality; but about behaviour - an observable set of skills &amp; abilities.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Programmes/2024/2024_Student_leader_2.png"></div><p>&nbsp;Taking reference from research and Kouzes’ theories, in the area of student leadership development, UPS focuses on the inculcation of the 21st century skills &amp; competencies to attain the desired student outcomes of <strong>Passionate &amp; Self-Directed Learner, Resilient &amp; All-Rounded Individual, Concerned &amp; Active Citizen who are anchored firmly on a set of core values.</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p></p><p><em>&nbsp;</em></p><p><strong>Guiding Principles of SLD</strong></p><p>Our student leadership is steered by the school’s philosophy that <strong>Everyone Matters</strong> &amp; hence the following beliefs:</p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every student can be developed as a leader.</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Leadership opportunities should be provided for all students.</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Leadership development needs to be intentional.</p><p></p><p><strong>(Insert Picture 7, 8 &amp; 9)</strong></p><p></p><p>As such, we seek to provide learning opportunities for students to:</p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lead Self (Tier 1)</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lead Peers beyond Class (Tier 2)</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lead School (Tier 3)</p><p></p><p><strong>(Insert Picture 10, 11 &amp; 12)</strong></p><p><em>&nbsp;</em></p><p><strong>Approach to Leadership Development</strong></p><p>The school expects that a leader <strong>knows the way, goes the way &amp; shows the way</strong>. It is derived from the five principles of Kouzes’ The Leadership Challenge (Model the Way, Inspire a Shared Vision, Challenge the Process, Enable Others to Act, Encourage the Heart) &amp; inspired by John C. Maxwell.</p><p><strong><u>&nbsp;</u></strong></p><table><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Leadership Challenge Principles</strong></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="2"><p><strong>Our Definition</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="3" colspan="1"><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Model the Way</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Inspire a Shared Vision</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Challenge the Process</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enable Others to Act</p><p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Encourage the Heart</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Knows the way</strong></p><p><strong>(Head)</strong></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Being anchored in <strong>school values</strong> of Integrity, Respect, Resilience, Responsibility, Integrity, Care &amp; Harmony (R3ICH).</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Goes the way</strong></p><p><strong>(Hands)</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Being able to do what is right.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Shows the way</strong></p><p><strong>(Heart)</strong></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Being able to demonstrate &amp; inspire others to do what is right.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>(Insert Picture 13, 14, 15, 16 &amp; 17)</strong></p><p>We take a customised approach to student leadership training and development. We believe that Student Leaders must be able to demonstrate the school values of R3ICH (knows the way) &amp; the desired behaviours &amp; SE competencies (goes the way &amp; shows the way) under each respective tier of leadership. As such, we take into account the needs of each segment of student leaders as we provide progressive development throughout the six years of a student’s journey at UPS.</p><p><strong>(Insert Picture 18, 19 &amp; 20)</strong></p><p></p>
