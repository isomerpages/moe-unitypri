## **Geylang Serai Heritage Gallery**
Primary 4 students had the opportunity to go on a Learning Journey to the Geylang Serai Heritage Gallery after a hiatus of 2 years. They got to play the role of explorers to find out more about the history of Geylang Serai and its significance to the Malay and Muslim communities in Singapore. In total, they  explored 4 stations across the gallery. At each station were educators who were former residents in the area, to make the history come to life with their captivating stories and interesting artefacts. Students were immersed into the stories shared by these educators. They discovered more about the early origins of Geylang Serai where cash crop plantations were grown. This included the cultivation of lemongrass also known as serai in Malay which the area was named after. Students were also fascinated by the artefacts such as the life-sized gasing (spinning top) used in the leisure activities of yesteryears. They admired one of the artefacts adorned beautifully with striking colours, known as ‘hantaran dulang’, a gift tray presented by a groom to the bride. They also learnt how Geylang Serai came to be known as a marketplace for special occasions like weddings for the Malay community. All in all, the students had an exciting and enriching learning experience.
