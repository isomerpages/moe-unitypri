# NE Show

#### Jul 2â€“Aug 5

After a 2-year hiatus, our Primary 5 students were finally back at The Float @ Marina Bay for the National Day Parade (NDP) National Education (NE) Show earlier this term. Our students (and teachers too!) had been looking forward to this event, especially it being their first outdoor learning journey since the pandemic struck. For many of them, it was also their first time watching the NDP live! Some highlights that the students particularly enjoyed were the aerobatic displays by F-16 fighter jets, landings by the Red Lions parachutists and definitely, the fireworks at the end of the parade. The singing of our National Anthem and National Day songs together with thousands of other spectators also evoked a strong sense of unity and pride for this country that we call Home. At the end of the day, students left the school, tired, but with a renewed sense of belonging towards the nation and many fond memories of the day spent meaningfully with their teachers and classmates. Happy Birthday, Singapore!
