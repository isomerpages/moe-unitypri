<p><strong>Programme</strong>&nbsp;<strong>for Active Learning</strong>&nbsp;<strong>(PAL)</strong>&nbsp;is
an integral part of the curriculum for all Primary 1 and 2 students. The
programme engages students in hands-on and experiential learning through
the following modules: Drama, Music, Outdoor Education, Art and Sports
&amp; Games. Through these varied experiences, students are encouraged
to explore new interests and develop their character.</p>
<p>The activities are designed to nurture critical thinking, creativity and
teamwork. Students also acquire important social and emotional competencies
such as social awareness, responsible decision-making and relationship
management. Teacher-led discussions play a key role in helping students
reflect on their experiences and apply these lessons meaningfully.</p>
<p>At the end of their PAL journey in lower primary, students will be able
to demonstrate greater confidence, curiosity and a positive attitude towards
learning.</p>
