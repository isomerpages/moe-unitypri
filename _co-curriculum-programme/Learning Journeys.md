### **P1 Learning Journey – Road Safety and Walk Around the School**

At the start of the year, the P1 students went for their first learning journey to learn about road safety. They learnt how to use the zebra crossing and traffic light in a safe and responsible manner. At the same time, they explored the surrounding area around the school and practiced using common spaces in a careful and considerate manner.
