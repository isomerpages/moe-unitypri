### **English Language, Drama and Debating Club**
The English Language, Drama and Debating Club aims to develop our students into confident speakers.  They learn to express their thoughts and opinions confidently towards topics like current affairs, education and even policies.  They are taught oratorical skills and debating with their peers.  In Drama sessions, they will learn theatrical skills that would enable them to be better performers on stage.  Apart from vocal exercises and tongue twisters, students get to play games that aim to improve their reflex and teamwork during drama sessions as well.  Students would also be trained to showcase a short play.
