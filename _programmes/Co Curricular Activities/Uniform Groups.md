<p>The Scouts CCA is open to both boys and girls and hopes to provide an
environment which is intellectually stimulating, physically active and
directed towards satisfying the child’s basic need to face and overcome
various challenges. Students will be exposed to varied activities which
would allow them to step out of their comfort zone to develop their character.
Through these activities, students will become more confident and civic-conscious
citizens. Some of the activities include going on field trips to learn
more about other occupations, campcraft and survival skills. Students will
also learn skills that would develop their creativity and enhance their
problem-solving skills.
