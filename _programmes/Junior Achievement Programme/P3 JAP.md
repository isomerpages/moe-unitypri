The Primary 3 students explored essential financial concepts, including earning, spending, saving, and donating. They learned that money would need to be earned before it could be used and how to create a personal budget. They practised distinguishing between wants and needs and comparing prices across different stores for the same item. They learned that spending was not their only option. Saving or donating could also be viable choices. This learning experience equipped the students with valuable financial knowledge, empowering them to make informed decisions to align with their financial goals and aspirations.
