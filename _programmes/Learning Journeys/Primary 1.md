### **Around the School &amp; Road Safety Walk**

P1 Learning Journey Around the School Neighbourhood &amp; Road Safety Walk was conducted for all P1 students in Term 1. The outing served to help students understand the basic concepts of having safe behaviour while being outdoors and when using the road.

With the support of Class Parent Volunteers and School Operation Managers, the students together with their form teachers walked around the school vicinity to familiarise themselves experientially with the traffic signals at crossings and the road hazards they might encounter. The students also stopped by at the nearby playgrounds where they learned safe and mindful behaviour while having fun playing together.

The students had a wonderful time exploring around the school neighbourhood with their classmates, teachers and parent volunteers even though it was a rather warm morning. The fun, excitement and educational experience more than made up for the humid weather!

### **Jacob Ballas**

In Term 3 Week 4, Primary 1 students went on a Learning Journey to Jacob Ballas Childrenâ€™s Garden. Nestled within the heart of Singapore Botanic Gardens, the Jacob Ballas Children's Garden is a vibrant and interactive space designed exclusively for young learners. Our students embarked on a day of immersive exploration, where they engaged with the wonders of nature in an educational setting. 

Students completed different tasks at 5 different stations around the park which allowed them to:

-	Develop an appreciation for the natural world and its diversity.
-	Acquire knowledge about plant life cycles, habitats, and environmental   
           conservation.
-	Foster a sense of wonder and curiosity through hands-on exploration.
-	Build teamwork and communication skills through group activities.

All in all, both students and teachers had an enjoyable time, engaging with nature in a meaningful and educational way.

### **River Wonders**
On 2 October 2023, the P1 students went on a learning journey to the River Wonders. A pre-learning journey lesson was conducted to introduce the various zones and prepare the students for the trip. 
<br>Together with the Form Teachers and Parent Volunteers, the students completed different tasks assigned at the Mekong River, Giant Panda Forest and Amazon Flooded Forest. The friendly and gentle manatees at the Amazon Flooded Forest enthralled the students. They were equally excited to see the Electric Eel, Piranha and Red Panda and in awe by the Giant Stingrays at the Mekong River. The highlight of the visit was getting to see Kai Kai and Le Le at the Panda Enclosure. 
<br>Overall, the LJ was a huge success with the students learning about the different animals and having a wonderful time bonding with one another.
