### Our Curriculum
--------------

Our school curriculum is designed with three key Learning Domains; _see, express and appreciate_. These enable our students to develop their observation and inquiry skills, create and innovate; and make connections and respond to art. Inquiry-based learning approach is central in our art classroom where our students are engaged in different level of inquiry discussion, exploration and experimentation.
