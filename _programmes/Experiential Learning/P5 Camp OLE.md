During the September holidays, our Primary 5 students attended Outdoor Learning Experience, or in short, OLE! The objectives of the 2-Day non-residential day camp are to allow students to build interpersonal relationship with peers, experience and appreciate the outdoors and to develop resilience and ruggedness in a safe and fun environment. The overarching theme is ‘Fortitude’ - the mental and emotional strength in facing difficulty or temptation courageously. Students were given a scenario where they are travellers in the year 2121, trying to find their way home in a world ravaged by climate change. On that journey, they would have to overcome “obstacles” that will take them out of their comfort zones and test their tenacity.

On the morning of 5 September, students eagerly arrived in school raring to go on their journey of self-discovery. Activities such as the team bonding and the icebreakers helped students get to know themselves and their team mates a little better. The Nature Walk took students on a 5-kilometre journey around Pang Sua Park Connector to discover the flora and fauna around the neighbourhood.

Back in school, students had to scale the rock wall, experience outdoor cooking using a mess tin and solid fuel, and even pitch a tent. Their listening skills and patience were also tested during the Orienteering activity, when each group had to navigate the school to find hidden QR codes while solving puzzles. Students learned to listen to each other, to be open to making mistakes and learning from them and moving forward as a team.

Many of the P5 students reflected that they valued their time at camp because they learnt to be more independent, to carry the lessons of resilience in times of adversity and have the courage to face their fears into their everyday lives after camp. We wish them the very best in their journey of becoming the best versions of themselves!
