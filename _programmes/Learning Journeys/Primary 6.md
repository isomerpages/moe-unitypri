### **Learning Journey to Singapore Discovery Centre**
To deepen their understanding of how Singapore has progressed since gaining independence, the Primary 6 students went on a learning journey to the Singapore Discovery Centre (SDC) where they experienced the Singapore Story from the past to the present through a multi-sensory approach. Through various activities, such as the interactive videos and games, students learnt more about the different challenges Singapore faced in the past as well as the future challenges the nation might face. Students then reflected on how these challenges could be overcome as a nation.<br>
Besides the exhibitions at SDC, students also had a chance to hop onto the SAFTI Military Institute bus for an exclusive tour around the training ground for officers-to-be. They got a glimpse into the life of an officer cadet and the role of the Singapore Armed Forces in the defence and security of Singapore. <br>
The students thoroughly enjoyed this eye-opening experience.

### **Ancient Civilisations Museum**

History came alive for the Primary 6 students during a Museum-Based Learning Journey to the Ancient Civilisations Museum. 

As students went from one station to another, the knowledgeable museum educators shared captivating stories and artefacts that unravelled historical moments. Being able to relate some of the stories to what they had learnt during Social Studies lessons, the students responded enthusiastically to the questions posed by the museum educators.

At the end of the learning journey, the students could explain how Singaporeâ€™s cultural heritage had evolved over time, influenced by the diverse mix of cultures. Additionally, they had gained a deeper understanding of the cultural and historical ties that had influence on the countries in Southeast Asia

### **Race to Sustainability (Gardens by the Bay)**
Race to Sustainability at Gardens by the Bay is an annual event taken part by our P6 students. After a 2-year hiatus due to Covid-19 measures, Race to Sustainability returns in a format that differs from previous editions. Students have to make use of their IT skills and devices to navigate the clues and codes to solve tasks involving teamwork and their knowledge of green messages learnt in school and beyond.

The students not only enjoyed the outdoors, immersing themselves in the flora around Gardens by the Bay, they also took time to enjoy the company of the classmates and teachers in their last learning journey before graduating from Unity Primary School. To end off the learning journey, students undertook an Math and Science trail designed by our teachers where they put their skills into actions to solve puzzles such as calculating the area and height of the super trees, and learn about the threats faced by the vegetation in different parts of the world.

It was definitely an enriching and unforgettable experience for both the students and staff.

### **Learning Journey to Sungei Buloh**
Nothing beats going out into nature and observing animals in their habitat! That was what the P6 students experienced when they spent half their morning soaking in the sun to hike Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserves. They observed the diversity of living things forming the mangrove community and realized the importance of mangrove in the ecosystem. They were lucky to encounter the mudskippers in the muddy waters, the monitor lizards taking a dip in the pond and catching sights of some of the migratory birds grazing on the mudflats. The learning journey complemented the Science topics of Living Together and Adaptations which the students learnt in class. Students had much fun learning beyond the classroom.
