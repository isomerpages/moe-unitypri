Cyber Wellness Programme
========================
![](/images/UPS-Website-Banners-3.png)

In Unity Primary Cyber Wellness programme, there are two principles to guide students in their actions:

1) Respect for Self and Others

Students need to:

*   uphold their own dignity when online
*   respect others

2) Safe and Responsible Use

Students need to:

*   understand risks of harmful and illegal online behaviours, and learn to protect themselves and to avoid online dangers
*   evaluate consequences of online decisions/behaviours and make responsible choices to protect themselves and the community

Students are taught the different topics during their FTGP (Form Teacher Guidance Period) lessons as well as Assembly Talks held throughout the year. Follow-up group activities using cyber wellness learning sheets are conducted after each assembly talk.

### **Cyber Wellness Ambassadors**

The roles of Cyber Wellness Student Ambassadors are very important as they help to ensure that the rules of netiquette are followed in online learning portals, which includes SLS.  Selected Cyber Wellness Student Ambassadors will attend the Cyber Wellness Ambassador Conference every year.  After the conference, they used the skills learnt and collaborate to design activities for the school’s Outreach Programme by focusing on Cyber Wellness, such as Cyber Safety.  Some of the activities designed by them include games and ICT quizzes to engage their peers during recess.
