Unity Primary School was established in 1999 and it is with great honour and pride that we commemorate our school’s 25th anniversary this year. As we journey along this momentous milestone, let us reflect on how In Unity, we have accomplished many little successes and overcome whatever challenges thus far. The dedication, commitment and conviction of our staff, with the ardent and unwavering support of our parents, our School Advisory Committee and various partners, in support of quality and holistic education to bring about the desired outcomes for our students, has been meaningful and worthwhile.

As we inspire and educate our young charges, we cannot do it alone. Parents play an equally critical role in our children’s education. It is imperative that the school and families work collaboratively to yield the best educational outcomes. The primary school years solidify the foundation for learning and parents support in ensuring their child comes to school prepared to learn is essential for their continual development.

We seek to deliver a holistic education that makes learning meaningful, builds character and ensures that every child is equipped with the skills and competencies to navigate the future. We are committed to providing quality teaching and learning in and out of the classrooms and value adding to the lives of our students. As stated in MOE Singapore Curriculum Philosophy, we believe that learning flourishes in caring and safe learning environment; when children construct knowledge actively; through the development of thinking skills and dispositions; and when assessment is used to address learning gaps.

As stewards of lives, we take pride in our work and consider it a privilege to be able to nurture and mould the future of Singapore. We envisage developing every student to have a 'Creative Mind', become a 'Confident Self', have a 'Caring Heart' and that all our students will become somebody one day, leaving an indelible mark wherever they go!

We know that 2024 will be an equally exciting year for all our students, especially our Primary 1 students as they embark on the next phase of their education journey. Our students will always be at the core of our mission and they can look forward to many opportunities for development such as learning to get along with friends from different background, learning about our fragile natural environment, and more importantly, learning more about themselves and what they are good at! 

With your continued support and partnership, we forge ahead with faith as always in touching lives and transforming futures!
