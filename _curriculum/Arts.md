This year, the showcased artworks revolved around Optical Illusion Art, drawing inspiration from the local artist Anthony Poon and his piece "Black and White" (1970). This particular artwork holds significance as it forms part of the MOE syllabus and aligns with our recently revamped school curriculum.</p><p>&nbsp;The Art Teachers took on the task of enlightening students about the artist's background and the motivations behind the creation of the artwork. Students underwent an intensive process that demanded perseverance, determination, and precision in shaping their designs, mirroring our school's core values. Throughout the creation phase, they employed mathematical precision to ensure their artwork could effectively convey the illusion of depth. This hands-on experience allowed them to step into the artist's shoes, comprehending his methodologies and artistic approach.</p><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Curriculum/2024/Untitled_14.png"></div><p>The art exhibition presents an excellent opportunity for our graduating members of the Young Artist Club to enhance their expertise and capabilities as they take charge of curating the event. Throughout this process, they acquired insights into the curatorial procedures and gained hands-on experience in tasks such as determining the exhibition layout and artwork placement. They meticulously considered elements like the exhibition's flow, visual impact, and conveyed narrative.</p><p>This valuable experience serves not only to cultivate their teamwork, organizational, and creative skills but also provides a platform for them to articulate their artistic concepts and ideas.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Curriculum/2024/art_15.png"></div><p></p>
