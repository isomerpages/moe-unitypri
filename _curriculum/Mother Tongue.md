### **Mother Tongue Language Curriculum and Aims**

The Mother Tongue Language curriculum aims to inculcate in all our students 3 broad objectives in the teaching and learning of MTL:  
1. **Communication** – to develop proficient language users who can communicate in a confident, effective and meaningful way in real-life situations.
2. **Culture** – to nurture our students to understand and have a deeper appreciation for their culture and traditions associated with each MTL in our society.
3. **Connection** – to enable our students to connect with communities across Asia who speak and share the language and culture.

The Mother Tongue Department in UPS uses student-centered approach, which focuses on teaching MTL in a fun and interactive manner.  This will help students to be active and competent users of the language. Differentiated learning is adopted to cater to pupils with different learning profile and ability. This is to gradually build up students’ competency and understanding in the language. Explicit teaching of MTL will help students to improve on their mastery of the language.

_\*There are only P1 and P2 Tamil Language students in 2023._
