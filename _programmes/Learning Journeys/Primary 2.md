### **Hay Dairies Goat Farm**
On 11 August 2022, the P2 students went on a learning journey to the Hay Dairies Goat Farm in Lim Chu Kang. The objectives of the learning journey were for the students to identify the different species of goats and understand the behaviour of goats. 

Upon arrival, the students were introduced to the goat milking area and got to watch the milking process. The owner of the premises, Mr John Hay, explained the difference between cow’s and goat’s milks and their benefits. Students learned the difference between the meat from sheep (mutton) and goat (chevon). 

Thereafter, they collected bags of alfalfa hay to feed the goats and moved to the barn. At the barn, some students were thrilled to feed the goats at close range while others needed more time to get used to it and decided to feed the goats at a distance. A few brave students also petted the goats and allowed the goats to eat from their palms. The students enjoyed the rare feeding experience. 

At the end of the tour, students received drawstring bags and bottles of chocolate milk as souvenirs for their trip to the Hay Dairies Goat Farm. It was indeed a unique learning journey for them.

### **River Wonders**
After missing out on the opportunity to visit River Wonders due to COVID in 2021, the P2 students and teachers were elated to be able to embark on their LJ at the end of Term 2 this year when the SMMs were eased. All of them had a fascinating time seeing the actual animals which they saw on the virtual LJ last year. The sight of manatees and giant stingrays at the Amazon Flooded Forest enthralled the students. Many saw electric eel and piranha for the first time. The highlight of the visit was getting to see Jia Jia and Le Le at the panda enclosure. It was a sight to behold, with Le Le perched on the tree branch, enjoying his nap! Importantly, the classes had a wonderful time bonding with one another on their 1st ever LJ since they joined Unity Primary School at P1.

### **Supermarket**
In this LJ, P2 students experienced planning for a class party and learnt how to purchase items online from the Supermarket websites.

Prior to the planning, the students were introduced to the following concepts:
* Estimation
* Budgeting
* Reading of the nutrition labels of items
* Importance of sourcing for heathier choices
* Difference between needs and wants
*  Importance of saving

They had the opportunity to apply the skills learnt when they had to plan what to buy for a week of snack breaks.

The students were also strongly encouraged to visit the supermarket with their parents. At the end of term 4, the students had a class party and they had a whale of time!
