### Our Curriculum
--------------

Our school curriculum is designed with three key Learning Domains; _see, express and appreciate_. These enable our students to develop their observation and inquiry skills, create and innovate; and make connections and respond to art. Inquiry-based learning approach is central in our art classroom where our students are engaged in different level of inquiry discussion, exploration and experimentation.

### **Art Gallery**
---------------

Our students love art. It is fun and it provides them with an opportunity for self-expression. Through the process of art making, our students discover more about themselves and about their peers. In this gallery, students’ imaginative visual expression and unique artistic voice can be seen.
