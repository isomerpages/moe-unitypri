<p>The Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) department aims to develop
responsible and respectful students &amp; citizens with integrity by providing
a learning environment where good values are instilled and cultivated.</p>
<h3><strong><u>Key Programmes for Character Development</u></strong></h3>
<h5><strong>Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP)</strong></h5>
<p>The main objectives of Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP) are to provide
quality interaction time between Form Teachers and students, and to equip
students with social and emotional (SE) competencies.</p>
<p>Conducted once a week, FTGP lessons allows purposeful student-teacher
interactions and the explicit teaching of SE competencies. Teachers also
make use of this platform for students to reflect and deepen their learning
of the school values. Students will experience positive school experiences
that support their holistic development and better prepare them for life.</p>

<h5><strong>Student Leadership</strong></h5>
<p>In UPS, we believe that every child can be a leader. With this firm belief,
all students are given opportunities to learn leadership skills and platforms
to exemplify these skills.</p>
<p>To ensure we achieve our student outcome of developing Effective Communicators,
Student Leadership training incorporates effective communication skills
so that students see the importance of being able to articulate and communicate
effectively to become competent leaders. Progressive development in the
leadership training also ensures student leaders are equipped with the
appropriate skills in order to carry out their duties.</p>

<h5><strong>Caught in Action! (CIA)</strong></h5>
<p>In Unity where students exemplify the school values, students are rewarded
when they are “caught” doing good deeds. Teachers and staff are always
on the lookout for acts of graciousness and appreciation.</p>
<p>Students embodying the school values are presented with tokens of appreciation
and their stories of good deeds are shared with the school.</p>

<h5><strong>P6 Camp Unité</strong></h5>
<p>The P6 Camp Unité is organised for our graduating cohort to have the opportunity
during their last year in UPS to experience cohort activities to fortify
community spirit and competencies as they embrace the challenges ahead
for transition to the next phase of their educational journey. Through
games and activities out of their classroom, students get to learn and
demonstrate resilience, teamwork and self-confidence. They will also be
motivated to give their best and have the desire to excel.</p>

<h3><strong><u>Key Programmes for Citizenship</u></strong></h3>
<h5><strong>National Education and Social Studies</strong></h5>
<p>National Education (NE), is part of our holistic education, firmly built
on our school core values of Respect, Resilience, Responsibility, Integrity,
Care and Harmony (R³ICH). It aims to develop national cohesion, cultivate
the instinct for survival as a nation and instil in our students, confidence
in our nation’s future. It also emphasises cultivating a sense of belonging
and emotional rootedness to Singapore.</p>
<p>Commemoration of NE events in our school focus on engaging our students
through their Head, Heart and Hands. Through the commemoration, students
will know Singapore better, love and take pride in being Singaporean and
look for avenues and opportunities to contribute and do their part for
Singapore.</p>

<h5><strong>Values in Action (VIA)</strong></h5>
<p>With our focus on Values-Driven Education, what better way to exemplify
our values than doing our part as Singaporeans, for our community and for
our country. Our Values-In-Action (VIA) Programme hence has a focus on
conserving our environment and emphasises the importance of keeping our
environment clean. We hope to instil in our students a sense of civic-mindedness
as well as build awareness among them, to spread the Green message to the
community. Various activities are planned for the students to do their
part for the community.</p>
<p>In the spirit of volunteerism, activities such as Food Donation Drive,
Share-A-Textbook, Weekly Recycling Drive and Litter Picking@Pang Sua Canal
are planned for students who want to do their part for the environment
and community beyond the level planned VIA programmes.</p>

<h5><strong>Friendship Week</strong></h5>
<p>UPS, in conjunction with Kindness Movement, comes together as a school
to spread positivity and kindness. In line with our vision of Caring Hearts,
we go beyond ourselves, and think of creative ways to show that we care
for people around us. It is about going beyond and spreading kindness,
making someone’s day.</p>
