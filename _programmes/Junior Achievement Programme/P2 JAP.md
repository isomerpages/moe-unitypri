### **Our Families**
The P2 students learnt that families can be alike and different in many ways and that they can play a part in their community. They learnt more about different jobs and businesses in a neighbourhood and how these provide income to provide for a family’s needs and wants. They even had the opportunity to be an entrepreneur and start their own business during the lessons! In all, they had lots of fun and brought home valuable lessons.
