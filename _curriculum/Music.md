<p>In UPS, we believe that music, alongside visual art and physical education,
is an important part of every child’s holistic education. Hence, all our
music programmes are geared towards providing our students with plenty
of opportunities to explore, develop and share their music talents and
skills.</p>
<p>The goal of the Music Department is to promote, encourage and develop
the love for music-making amongst students through engaging, challenging
and fun-loving activities, in line with the standards set by the General
Music Programme Syllabus.</p>
<p>The Music Department hopes that every student is be able to confidently
sing, play instrument and appreciate music through dance and movement activities.
Every music lesson should be a celebration of students’ effort, creativity
and artistry. Everyone should be able to support and show care for one
another, lifting each other up to achieve synergy, harmony and unity.</p>
<h3><strong><u>Key Programmes</u></strong></h3>
<p>To ensure all students have good foundation in music, our learning outcomes
are organised around overarching Learning Objectives (LO).</p>
<p>Our students learn these LO in an integrative manner, where elements and
concepts are discovered sequentially through active musical experiences.</p>
<p>Our P1 and P2 students learn music foundation through singing activities,
musical games, movement and non-pitched percussion instruments.</p>
<p>Our P3 to P6 students are offered opportunities to learn to play musical
instruments such as the recorder, xylophone and ukulele.</p>
<p>Aside from various music experiences in the classroom, all students are
also encouraged to showcase their talents during school events such as
National Day and for the P6 students, during their Graduation Day.</p>
<h5><strong>Unity Got Talent</strong></h5>
<p>Unity’s Got Talent started in 2017 to provide students with opportunities
to hone, express and share their talents. Students step up by auditioning,
rehearsing and performing during National Day. Through the experience,
it inculcates school values, civic literacy and national identity. It is
an event that both the teachers and students look forward to, where contestants
compete and represent their house colours, proving that they have the talent
and heart for the nation.</p>
