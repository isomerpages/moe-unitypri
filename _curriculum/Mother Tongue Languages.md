### **Mother Tongue Language Curriculum and Aims**

The Mother Tongue Language (MTL) curriculum aims to inculcate in all our students 3 broad objectives in the teaching and learning of MTL:  
1. **Communication** – to develop proficient language users who can communicate in a confident, effective and meaningful way in real-life situations.
2. **Culture** – to nurture our students to understand and have a deeper appreciation for their culture and traditions associated with each MTL in our society.
3. **Connection** – to enable our students to connect with communities across Asia who speak and share the language and culture.

The Mother Tongue Department in UPS uses student-centered approach, which focuses on teaching MTL in a fun and interactive manner.  This will help students to be active and competent users of the language. Differentiated learning is adopted to cater to students with different learning profile and ability. This is to gradually build up students’ competency and understanding in the language. Teachers also incorporate E-pedagogy in their teaching and facilitation of learning, where students are introduced to different useful ICT learning tools and platforms for their MTL learning.

Different learning packages such as oral, composition and reading comprehension are designed by teachers to help students be equipped with essential language skills. Parents’ workshops are conducted by our teachers to keep parents abreast of the latest examination formats, understand assessment-answering techniques and share some useful and effective study tips to help their children at home.

### **<u>Key Programmes</u>**
##### **Mother Tongue Fortnight (Primary 1 to 6)**
The objective of the Mother Tongue Fortnight (MTFN) is to create an immersive environment that promotes the Joy of Learning & an appreciation of the MTL. During the two consecutive weeks, a wide range of activities related to language and culture are conducted. These activities provide authentic opportunities for students to use their MTL and experience the culture.
