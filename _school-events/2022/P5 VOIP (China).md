The 2nd Virtual Overseas Immersion Experience to Wuxi & Shanghai, China, for our P5 students was held on Mon, 30 May 22 from 8 am to 4 pm to achieve the following objectives: 

• Expose students to the culture of the local school through virtual interaction with the twinning school students. 

• Provide opportunities for students to develop their communication skills in both English (EL) & Chinese Languages (CL). 

• Inculcate the appreciation of the Chinese culture in an experiential manner. 

• Promote cross-cultural sensitivity & understanding in our students by having the opportunity to experience being student ambassadors of Singapore. 

The programme entailed virtual tour of places of cultural & educational interest in Wuxi & Shanghai as well as virtual interactions with students in a local school. There were also hands-on activities for students to experience & appreciate the beauty of Chinese Culture. 

Overall, the students enjoyed themselves tremendously and gained new learning while making friends beyond Singapore shore.
